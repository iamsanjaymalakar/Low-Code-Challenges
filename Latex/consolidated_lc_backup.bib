 abstract = {The identifiers chosen by programmers as function names contain valuable information. They are often the starting point for program understanding activities, especially when high-level views, like the call graph, are available. In this paper, the lexical, syntactic and semantic structure of function identifiers is analyzed by means of a segmentation technique, a regular language and a conceptual classification. The application of these analyses to a database of procedural programs suggests some potential uses of the results, ranging from support for program understanding to the evolution towards standard and more maintainable forms of programs},

 abstract = {The identifiers chosen by programmers as function names contain valuable information. They are often the starting point for program understanding activities, especially when high-level views, like the call graph, are available. In this paper, the lexical, syntactic and semantic structure of function identifiers is analyzed by means of a segmentation technique, a regular language and a conceptual classification. The application of these analyses to a database of procedural programs suggests some potential uses of the results, ranging from support for program understanding to the evolution towards standard and more maintainable forms of programs},

Several different application area's are mentioned:

3) re-documenting an existing source
4) traceability improvement
5) migration support (towards oo)
