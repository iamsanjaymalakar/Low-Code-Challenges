<p>I created a Java servlet and JSP that runs on Google App Engine. The servlet will connect to Zoho CRM to retrieve all leads and geocode the addresses they are registered with. The client-side Javascript is then taking care of creating the markers on the map for all the addresses. </p>

<p>Every development tool/language/stack/... involves some tradeoffs at some point. Therefore, depending on what you're looking for, or particularly interested in, you may consider some aspect of a platform as an unforgivable pitfall where others might see it as a godsend blessing, or vice-versa. Thus, only by knowing what you really like and what you consider essential, may I try to guess what you'll miss and what you'll consider a pitfall.</p>

<p>Since we usually only notice the lack of something the first time we try to use it, I'd recommend trying to use the platform to hack something at your will without following the tutorials and the courses to the letter. If while creating something different you find anything you dislike, we'll be happy to hear it from you!</p>

<p>e^(Log(number)/index)</p>

<p>where number is the radicand and index is the desired root.</p>

<p>Eg: The 10th root of the number 1024:
e^(Log(1024)/10) = 2.</p>

using Intuit.QuickBase.Client;

namespace MyProgram.QB.Interaction
{
    class MyApplication
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var client = QuickBase.Client.QuickBase.Login(""your_QB_username"", ""your_QB_password"");
            var application = client.Connect(""your_app_dbid"", ""your_app_token"");
            var table = application.GetTable(""your_table_dbid"");
            table.Query();

            foreach(var record in table.Records)
            {

            }
            client.Logout();
        }

</code></pre>

<p>To do specific query using the already built C# API, you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>var querystring1 = new QueryStrings(FieldID,ComparisonOperator.GTE,value,LogicalOperator.AND);
var querystring2 = new QueryStrings(FieldID, ComparisonOperator.XEX, value, LogicalOperator.NONE);
</code></pre>

<p>then </p>

<pre><code>    var query = new Query();
query.Add(querystring1);
query.Add(querystring2);
table.Query(query, new[] { 1,2,3,4}, new[] { 1,2});
</code></pre>

<p>The second parameter is the field IDs of the columns you want and the Third parameter is the field ID's to sort the records by.</p>

<p>In your case I would just do the loop and add all the records to a collection. Then you could probably use LINQ or just the column headings to loop through all your records.</p>

<p>This is the way I did it to get specific data:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(var record in table.Records)
            {
                var row = new String[8];
                row[0] = record[""Column Name""];
                row[1] = record[""Column Name""];
                row[2] = record[""Column Name""];
                row[3] = record[""Column Name""];
                row[4] = record[""Column Name""];
                row[5] = record[""Column Name""];
                row[6] = record[""Column Name""];
                row[7] = record[""Column Name""];

<p>But to make a basic tooltip with proper positioning, you can use the below. I have used it and it works !!</p>

<p>JS (will have two mwthods, showTip and hideTip) :</p>

var x=0;
var y=0;
var m;
var h;

var e=window.event;
if(e.pageX||e.pageY) { x=e.pageX;  y=e.pageY;  }
else if(e.clientX||e.clientY)
{ x=e.clientX+document.body.scrollLeft+document.documentElement.scrollLeft;y=e.clientY+document.body.scrollTop+document.documentElement.scrollTop;}
m=document.getElementById('myTooltip');
if((y&gt;10)&amp;&amp;(y&lt;450))
{  m.style.top=y-4+""px"";  }
else{  m.style.top=y+4+""px"";  }
var messageHeigth=(message.length/20)*10+25;
if((e.clientY+messageHeigth)&gt;510)
{  m.style.top=y-messageHeigth+""px""; }
if(x&lt;850) { m.style.left=x+20+""px"";  }
else{  m.style.left=x-170+""px"";  }
m.innerHTML=message;m.style.display=""block"";m.style.zIndex=203;
}

function hidetip(){
var m;
m=document.getElementById('myTooltip');m.style.display=""none"";
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>CSS:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style type=""text/css""&gt;
#myTooltip{padding: 5px; background-color: #FFF8DC;  border: 1px solid #DEB887; width:180px;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; color: #6b6b6b; display:none; position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px; }
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the HTML (will have an extra DIV below the href to show tooltip):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""javascript:void(0)"" onmouseover=""showtip(event, 'Sample tooltip text');""
onmouseout=""hidetip();""&gt;Hover mouse to see tooltip text.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div id=""myTooltip"" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;

18376080,2,18335697,2013-08-22T09:10:05.233,26,"<p>I'm having the same problem with connection timeouts. It seems to me that there are issues around SSL sockets in the default Django SMTP library. In the development version of Django there is an option to set <code>EMAIL_USE_SSL = True</code> which allows for the use of an <em>implicit</em> TLS connection (as opposed to <em>explicit</em>, which is specified by <code>EMAIL_USE_TLS = True</code>). Generally the former (implicit) uses port 465, while the latter (explicit) uses port 587. See the <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#email-use-ssl"">Django docs</a> -- compare the development version with version 1.5. Note that the option <code>EMAIL_USE_SSL</code> is NOT present in 1.5.</p>

<p>Thus, the problem is that <a href=""https://www.zoho.com/mail/help/faq/imap-access1.html#f2a2"">Zoho's default SMTP server uses port 465 and requires SSL</a>, but the <code>EMAIL_USE_TLS</code> option doesn't fulfill this requirement. (Side note: maybe try setting this option to <code>False</code>? I didn't try that.) Anyway, my best guess is that this is a Django-specific issue and may not be solved until 1.7.</p>

<p>As for a solution to your problem: you can definitely access Zoho's SMTP server with Python (2.7.1)'s <code>smtplib</code> (see script below). So, if you want a slightly inelegant fix, you could go that route. I've tested this in Django 1.5.1 and it works like a charm.</p>

<p>Here's the stand-alone Python script (which can be adapted for use in a Django project):</p>

<pre><code>import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

# Define to/from
sender = 'sender@example.com'
recipient = 'recipient@example.com'

# Create message
msg = MIMEText(""Message text"")
msg['Subject'] = ""Sent from python""
msg['From'] = sender
msg['To'] = recipient

# Create server object with SSL option
server = smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.zoho.com', 465)

# Perform operations via server
server.login('sender@example.com', 'password')
server.sendmail(sender, [recipient], msg.as_string())
server.quit()
</code></pre>

<p>Try checking that the above script runs with your Zoho credentials before plugging it into your web project. Good luck!</p>

<p>First, create a function that you can call from anywhere (e.g. when a new sub-form record is added or changed)--for details on that, go here: <a href=""http://www.zoho.com/creator/help/script/functions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zoho.com/creator/help/script/functions.html</a></p>

<p>This function will first duplicate the sub-form records by the parent record ID (sorting by the appropriate column) and then delete all sub-form records that were inserted before the script started:</p>

<pre><code>int SubFormRecords_SortByAnything_ReturnCount(int ParentRecordID)
{
    scriptStartTime = zoho.currenttime;
    for each rSubFormRecord in SubFormRecords  [ParentFieldName = input.ParentRecordID] sort by FieldName1, FieldName3, FieldName2
    {
        NewSubFormRecordID = insert into SubFormRecords
        [
            FieldName1 = rSubFormRecord.FieldName1
            FieldName2 = rSubFormRecord.FieldName2
            FieldName3 = rSubFormRecord.FieldName3
        ];
    }
    delete from SubFormRecords[ (Series == input.ParentRecordID &amp;&amp; Added_Time &lt; scriptStartTime) ];
    return SubFormRecords[ParentFieldName == input.EventID].count();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once the above sorting function is in place (customized for your application), call it when appropriate.  I call it when adding a record associated with the sub-form, or when I change the sorting column values.</p>

<p>That works well, and as long as you don't have complex logic associated with adding and deleting records, it should have minimal impact on application performance.</p>

<p>Please let me know whether that works for you, and if you have any better ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> This solution is not suitable for forms containing additional sub-form records because deleting the records will delete linked sub-form values.</p>

Internally the Mendix platform uses Ehcache to do that. </p>

<p>However it is not really possible to influence that cache as you would normally do in Java/Spring.This is due to all the functionality of the Mendix Platform, that already tries to cache all objects as efficiently as possible.<br>
Every object you create is always added to the cache. When working with that object it stays in cache until the Platform detects that the specific object can no longer be accessed either through the UI or a microflow.
There are also API calls available that instruct the platform to retain the object in cache regardless of it's usage. But that doesn't provide you with the flexibility as you asked for.
<br>
<br><br>
But specifically on your question, my initial response would be: Why would you want to cache a microflow output?<br>
Objects are already cached in memory, and the browser client only refreshes the cache when instructed. Any objects that you are using will be cached. 
Also when looking at most of the microflows that we use, I don't think it is likely that I would want to cache the output instead of re-running the microflows. Due to the design of the majority of the microflows I think it is likely that most microflows can return a slightly different output every time you execute it.</p>

<p>There are many listener classes you can subscribe to in the Mendix platform that allow you to trigger something in addition to the default action. But that would require some detailed knowledge of the current behavior.<br>
For example you can override the login action, but if you don't perform all the correct validations you could make the login process less secure. </p>

29910145,2,29905159,2015-04-28T04:08:12.920,12,"<p>Let's begin by reviewing how <code>Dict</code> and <code>(:-)</code> are meant to be used.</p>

<pre><code>ordToEq :: Dict (Ord a) -&gt; Dict (Eq a)
ordToEq Dict = Dict
</code></pre>

<p>Pattern matching on a value <code>Dict</code> of type <code>Dict (Ord a)</code> brings the constraint <code>Ord a</code> into scope, from which <code>Eq a</code> can be deduced (because <code>Eq</code> is a superclass of <code>Ord</code>), so <code>Dict :: Dict (Eq a)</code> is well-typed.</p>

<pre><code>ordEntailsEq :: Ord a :- Eq a
ordEntailsEq = Sub Dict
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, <code>Sub</code> brings its input constraint into scope for the duration of its argument, allowing this <code>Dict :: Dict (Eq a)</code> to be well-typed as well.</p>

<p>However, whereas pattern-matching on <code>Dict</code> brings a constraint into scope, pattern-matching on <code>Sub Dict</code> does not bring into scope some new constraint conversion rule. In fact, unless the input constraint is already in scope, you can't pattern-match on <code>Sub Dict</code> at all.</p>

<pre><code>-- Could not deduce (Ord a) arising from a pattern
constZero :: Ord a :- Eq a -&gt; Int
constZero (Sub Dict) = 0

-- okay
constZero' :: Ord a =&gt; Ord a :- Eq a -&gt; Int
constZero' (Sub Dict) = 0
</code></pre>

<p>So that explains your first type error, <code>""Could not deduce (a c) arising from a pattern""</code>: you have tried to pattern-match on <code>Sub Dict</code>, but the input constraint <code>a c</code> was not already in scope.</p>

<p>The other type error, of course, is saying that the constraints you did manage to get into scope were not sufficient to satisfy the <code>RecAll f rs b</code> constraint. So, which pieces are needed, and which ones are missing? Let's look at the definition of <code>RecAll</code>.</p>

<pre><code>type family RecAll f rs c :: Constraint where
  RecAll f [] c = ()     
  RecAll f (r : rs) c = (c (f r), RecAll f rs c)
</code></pre>

<p>Aha! <code>RecAll</code> is a type family, so unevaluated as it is, with a completely abstract <code>rs</code>, the constraint <code>RecAll f rs c</code> is a black box which could not be satisfied from any set of smaller pieces. Once we specialize <code>rs</code> to <code>[]</code> or <code>(r : rs)</code>, it becomes clear which pieces we need:</p>

<pre><code>recAllNil :: Dict (RecAll f '[] c)
recAllNil = Dict

recAllCons :: p rs
           -&gt; Dict (c (f r))
           -&gt; Dict (RecAll f rs c)
           -&gt; Dict (RecAll f (r ': rs) c)
recAllCons _ Dict Dict = Dict
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using <code>p rs</code> instead of <code>Proxy rs</code> because it's more flexible: if I had a <code>Rec f rs</code>, for instance I could use that as my proxy with <code>p ~ Rec f</code>.</p>

<p>Next, let's implement a version of the above with <code>(:-)</code> instead of <code>Dict</code>:</p>

<pre><code>weakenNil :: RecAll f '[] c1 :- RecAll f '[] c2
weakenNil = Sub Dict

weakenCons :: p rs
           -&gt; c1 (f r) :- c2 (f r)
           -&gt; RecAll f rs c1 :- RecAll f rs c2
           -&gt; RecAll f (r ': rs) c1 :- RecAll f (r ': rs) c2
weakenCons _ entailsF entailsR = Sub $ case (entailsF, entailsR) of
    (Sub Dict, Sub Dict) -&gt; Dict
</code></pre>

<p><code>Sub</code> brings its input constraint <code>RecAll f (r ': rs) c1</code> into scope for the duration of its argument, which we've arranged to include the rest of the function's body. The equation for the type family <code>RecAll f (r ': rs) c1</code> expands to <code>(c1 (f r), RecAll f rs c1)</code>, which are thus both brought into scope as well. The fact that they are in scope allows us to pattern-match on the two <code>Sub Dict</code>, and those two <code>Dict</code> bring their respective constraints into scope: <code>c2 (f r)</code>, and <code>RecAll f rs c2</code>. Those two are precisely what the target constraint <code>RecAll f (r ': rs) c2</code> expands to, so our <code>Dict</code> right-hand side is well-typed.</p>

<p>To complete our implementation of <code>weakenAllRec</code>, we will need to pattern-match on <code>rs</code> in order to determine whether to delegate the work to <code>weakenNil</code> or <code>weakenCons</code>. But since <code>rs</code> is at the type level, we cannot pattern-match on it directly. The <a href=""https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/hasochism.pdf"">Hasochism</a> paper explains how in order to pattern-match on a type-level <code>Nat</code>, we need to create a wrapper datatype <code>Natty</code>. The way in which <code>Natty</code> works is that each of its constructors is indexed by a corresponding <code>Nat</code> constructor, so when we pattern-match on a <code>Natty</code> constructor at the value level, the corresponding constructor is implied at the type level as well. We could define such a wrapper for type-level lists such as <code>rs</code>, but it just so happens that <code>Rec f rs</code> already has constructors corresponding to <code>[]</code> and <code>(:)</code>, and the callers of <code>weakenAllRec</code> are likely to have one lying around anyway.</p>

<pre><code>weakenRecAll :: Rec f rs
             -&gt; (forall a. c1 a :- c2 a)
             -&gt; RecAll f rs c1 :- RecAll f rs c2
weakenRecAll RNil       entails = weakenNil
weakenRecAll (fx :&amp; rs) entails = weakenCons rs entails
                                $ weakenRecAll rs entails
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the type of <code>entails</code> must be <code>forall a. c1 a :- c2 a</code>, not merely <code>c1 a :- c2 a</code>, because we don't want to claim that <code>weakenRecAll</code> will work for any <code>a</code> of the caller's choosing, but rather, we want to require the caller to prove that <code>c1 a</code> entails <code>c2 a</code> for every <code>a</code>.</p>

31481768,2,31386733,2015-07-17T17:47:12.667,1,"<p>First, I'm assuming that you're using this PHP SDK by QuickbaseAdmirer <a href=""https://github.com/QuickbaseAdmirer/QuickBase-PHP-SDK"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/QuickbaseAdmirer/QuickBase-PHP-SDK</a>.  There are a few potential problems with your code.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Double check that your constructor is correct.  Unless you've modified it, the Quickbase constructor in the SDK (again that I'm assuming you're using) takes user name, password, xml, database id, and then token in that order.  Whatever value is in <code>$config['debug']</code> may be taken as the token and the value of <code>$config['app_token']</code> may be taken as your realm.  Also, <code>$config['AA']</code> as used in the constructor should be a string of random seeming characters like ""bbqn1y5qv"".  Here's the constructor in the SDK for reference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>public function __construct($un, $pw, $usexml = true, $db = '', $token
  = '', $realm = '', $hours = '')</code></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Your query <code>$xml = $qbc-&gt;do_query(""{'"" . $config['AA'] . ""'.EX.''}"", 0, 0, 'a', 0, '', '');</code> is not returning any records because <code>$config['AA']</code> is both being used as your DBID (in the constructor) and your field ID in the query.  The DBID must be a string and the field ID must be an integer that corresponds to the field you're making the query for.  For example, if you wanted to return records created today your query would be <code>'{1.IR.today}'</code> because 1 is always the field ID for date created.  It's also not returning any records because the SDK requires queries be passed as an array of arrays.  So, my records created today query needs to be rewritten as:</p>

<p><code>$query= array(
                array(
                        'fid' =&gt; '1',
                        'ev' =&gt; 'IR'),
                        'cri' =&gt; 'today'),
                );</code></p>

<p>You'll also need to pass a string of period separated values to the clist parameter of the method or leave it blank for the table defaults. For example, if I wanted to get the date created and record ID for all records in this table sorted by date ascending, I would use this:</p>

<p><code>$query= array(
                array(
                        'fid' =&gt; '3',
                        'ev' =&gt; 'GT'),
                        'cri' =&gt; '0'),
                );
$xml = $qbc-&gt;do_query($query, '', '', '1.3', '1', '', 'sortorder-A');</code></p>

<p>You can read up more on the Quickbase API, and do_query specifically, here <a href=""http://www.quickbase.com/api-guide/index.html#do_query.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quickbase.com/api-guide/index.html#do_query.html</a>  </p></li>
<li><p>The add record API call takes pairs of field IDs and values.  The SDK handles that by taking an array of arrays with 'fid' and 'value' pairs.  Assuming you want to put the value of <code>$record-&gt;record_id_</code> in field #37 and <code>$record-&gt;account_number</code> in field #30 your code should look like this:</p>

<p><code>foreach($xml-&gt;record as $record) {
   $records= array(
                array(
                        'fid' =&gt; '37',  //Whatever field you want to store the value to
                        'value' =&gt; $record-&gt;record_id_),
                array(
                        'fid' =&gt; '30',
                        'value' =&gt; $record-&gt;account_number),
                  );
   $xml = $qbc-&gt;add_record($records);
}</code></p>

<p>Throw in a <code>print_r($xml);</code> at the end and you can see any response from Quickbase for debugging.  You should get something like this for a success:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>SimpleXMLElement Object ( [action] =&gt; API_AddRecord [errcode] =&gt; 0 [errtext] =&gt; No error [rid] =&gt; 81 [update_id] =&gt; 1436476140453 )</code></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The way your code is presented, you may not get the results you expect.  Your do query and add record method calls are performed on the same table and that isn't normally what someone would want.  Usually, the goal is to perform a do query on one table and then use that data to add records in a different table.  If that's the case, you'll need to change the database ID in your <code>$qbc</code> object before you preform the add record call.  This is easy enough to do with <code>$qbc-&gt;set_database_table('DBID');</code> where DBID is the target table ID (which should be a string of random seeming characters like ""bbqn1y5qv"").</p></li>

Thus it will be necessary to create a custom JSON converter for a <code>List&lt;Folder&gt;</code> to skip through the array and match up the folders with their arrays of children.</p></li>

<ol>
<li>Trigger a logic when the input box changes.</li>
</ol>

<p>The input box has a property called ""Destination"" inside the ""On Change"" section. In that property, you can assign an action (imagine an action as a Java or .NET method). As you can figure out, that will be the action that will run when you change the input box text;</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Update the search result.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the action assigned to the ""Destination"" property, you should rerun the search using the ""Refresh Data"" widget and selecting the query. Then you must need to refresh the element in the screen. To do that, you can use the ""Ajax Refresh"" widget, and select the widget that is displaying the results.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Let's imagine that you have a data entity called ""City"" that represents.. a city. In the screen, you have an input box and below a ""Table Records"" with the list of cities. As you type in the input box, the ""Table Records"" is filtered using the value of the variable assigned to the input box.</p>

<p>To achieve this, you assign an action to the ""Destination"" property of the input box (let's call the action ""OnChange""). In the ""OnChange"" action, you rerun the aggregate being used to display the cities names (and that has a condition <em>City.Name like InputBox_Var + ""%""</em>) using the ""Refresh Data"".</p>

<p>After that, you put the ""Ajax Refresh"" widget next to the ""Refresh Data"", and select the aggregate (ensure that the aggregate has a name, otherwise you can't select it).</p>

<p>It should work!</p>

32575808,2,32571070,2015-09-15T00:23:06.647,1,"<p>I think you may be missing something in your query.  If you're trying to get a  list of records where the field 12 is 1157 and field 8 is equal to <code>$Child_ID</code> you'll need to add <code>AND</code> into your query.  When using the API in a URL the query would be <code>&amp;query={12.EX.1175}AND{8.EX.77}</code> if, for example, the child ID were 77.  To do that in the PHP SDK for Quickbase you add <code>'ao' =&gt; 'AND'</code> to all arrays following the first query array.  Try updating your $queries array to this:</p>

<pre><code>$queries = array( //this is the where clause now for the delete query
                array(
                    'fid'  =&gt; '12',
                    'ev'   =&gt; 'EX',
                    'cri'  =&gt; '1175'
                ),
                array(
                    'ao'   =&gt; 'AND',  // Saying that 12.EX.1175 AND 8.EX.$Child_ID
                    'fid'  =&gt; '8',
                    'ev'   =&gt; 'EX',
                    'cri'  =&gt; $Child_ID
                )
);
</code></pre>

<p>My PHP skills aren't particularly good, but you'll need to do a bit more to get the record ID#.  In the original code, I think that <code>$record-&gt;f[3]</code> will just return to SimpleXMLObject for the third field in the array.  That won't necessarily be field ID 3 (the record ID).  You can either choose to not use the structured format (and change all of your code to match) or add a loop that goes through all the fields and deletes when it reaches the field with id 3:</p>

<pre><code>foreach($results-&gt;table-&gt;records-&gt;record as $record){ //getting results of delete query
    //Loop through all fields to find id 3
    foreach($record-&gt;f as $field){
        if($field['id'] == ""3""){
            $Deletevar = $field['id'];
            $deleted = $qb-&gt;delete_record($Deletevar); //deleting result
            print_r($deleted);
            break;  //Stops this loop since FID 3 was found
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some performance notes:  If you aren't using any other fields,  you can set your query to only return record IDs by passing a clist that is just '3'.  Also, each <code>delete_record()</code> is a separate API call.  There is another method <code>purge_records</code> that allows you pass a query and Quickbase deletes all of the records that match your query.  You may want to look into using <code>purge_records()</code> because you can you use it in place of your <code>do_query()</code> and avoid all the loops.  It uses fewer of your resources and Quickbase's to process as well.</p>

<li>In the <code>ForEach</code> loop, instead of <code>ListAppend</code> use an <code>Assign</code> node</li>

<p>Here's a snippet of the answer:
In Chrome it's possible to hide this automatic header/footer using:</p>

<pre><code>@page { margin: 0; }
</code></pre>

<p>Since the contents will extend to page's limits, the page printing header/footer will be absent. You should, of course, in this case, set some margins/paddings in your body element so that the content won't extend all the way to the page's edge. Since common printers just can't get no-margins printing and it's probably not what you want, you should use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>@media print {
  @page { margin: 0; }
  body { margin: 1.6cm; }

<li>You can use another element (in the image bellow I used a buttongroup) to filter the year outside the calendar. Then, by doing an Ajax Refresh, get the data for that year and refresh the calendar.</li>

To avoid this error, you need to reduce the number of records being returned by the query.  If you aren't actually using all of the returned records in your program, you should structure your query so that you exclude records that you aren't using.  If you do, in fact, need all of the records in that table you'll need to download them in batches and then merge the datasets.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I've never programmed C# so I can't help you with the syntax, but to download records in batches you can use <code>API_GetSchema</code> on your table DBID to get the next record id (table.original.next_record_id).  This number is what the record ID will be for the next record to be created.  So, you know that all of your record IDs are less than that number.  Using a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 20,000 you can query for records where the record id is greater than the lower bound and less than the upperbound.  Merge the results with an existing dataset, increase both bounds by 20,000 and repeat until the lower bound exceeds the next record id number.  At the end you should have a single dataset and code that should scale with your Quickbase table.</p>

38156230,2,38112943,2016-07-02T03:33:52.087,0,"<p>I think the major problem that you're having here is repeated id values.  Each record in the report has a <code>DIV</code> with <code>id='mydivTable'</code>.  The id values aren't meant to be repeated in a document and doing so can result in unexpected behavior.  In this instance, your <code>$('#mydivTable')</code> call in your script is returning only the first element.  Fortunately, it appears to be a relatively easy fix.</p>

<p>First, change the first line in the formula of your <code>forcedgraph</code> field so that you give the <code>DIV</code> a class name of ""mydivTable"" instead of an id:</p>

<pre><code>""&lt;div class='div-table mydivTable' style='width: 355px;' data='""
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can query for all elements that have 'mydivTable' as a class.  Change your script file so that you're looking for classes instead of ids:</p>

<pre><code>  $("".mydivTable"").each(function() {
      var Rec = $(this).attr('data');
</code></pre>

<p>Changing <code>""#mydivTable""</code> to <code>this</code> ensures that you are assigning the value of the 'data' attribute for the specific element that <code>.each()</code> is iterating through to <code>Rec</code>.  Using <code>""#mydivtable""</code> will return nothing now that we've changed your field and using <code>"".mydivTable""</code> will return a collection of elements instead of just one.  </p>

<p>It should start working after those changes.  At least it did for me in my own mock up.</p>

38380487,2,38376454,2016-07-14T17:23:27.547,0,"<p>It looks like there are a couple issues causing your code to not work.  First, let me make a distinction between ""Calculated Fields"" and ""Formula Fields"" in Quickbase.  Calculated fields are defined in the report view (meaning they are viewable only in that report and no other) and do not allow HTML.  Formula fields, on the other hand, are created like traditional fields and allow you to select a checkbox allowing some HTML.  You'll need to use a formula field to get code to run in a form or report.  You'll also need to make sure you make the field visible in your report otherwise the code won't be executed.</p>

<p>Once that is resolved, your script probably won't run because Quickbase limits the HTML tags allowed.  Instead of changing the images, you'll just see the text of your script displayed in the field.  You can get around this by putting your script in the <code>onload</code> tag of an <code>IMG</code> element.  This will have the added effect of no longer requiring <code>document.ready(function(){});</code> to properly execute.</p>

<p>Finally, the last problem is the selector.  Even though you are using a formula field attached to a specific record, the script itself executes for the entire page.  In order to select only the <code>img</code> elements for the records where Task Name is ""Vacation"", you'll need a way to distinguish between rows.  Fortunately, the timeline report wraps each row in a <code>div</code> giving it an ID of ""rid"" + the record id.</p>

<p>So, if you put that all together you should end up with a formula text field with ""Allow some HTML tags to be inserted in the field"" checked and this as the formula: </p>

<pre><code>If([Task Name]=""Vacation"", ""&lt;img qbu=\""module\"" src=\""/i/clear2x2.gif\"" onload=\""javascript:$('#rid"" &amp; [Record ID#] &amp; "" &gt; td:has(div.timeline) &gt; div.timeline &gt; img').attr('src',('https://images.quickbase.com/si/16/821-check_purple.png'));\""&gt;"", """")

Single mail server MX can be set as default. You can set two different MX record but that would work as fail-over, it can't split your delivery.</p>

<p>Yes it is possible, the technology called Dual Delivery OR Split Delivery.  When emails are addressed to email addresses that are not found in one mail server it will send its delivery to another mail server and even can split them.</p>

<p><strong>For example</strong><br>
domain.com has default mx record set to Zoho. User abc@domain.com is set under google apps &amp; user xyz@domain.com under Zoho. Now if someone send mail to abc@domain.com which is configured under google apps, so the first request transferred to Zoho but zoho cannot found that email within organization so it will push the request to Google apps and will deliver the mail in its inbox.</p>

<p>Google Apps also offer dual delivery but unfortunately its available for Google Apps for Work account only. Zoho is offering it for all type of accounts so you still have chance to get it done via zoho.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>  </p>

<ol>
<li>Set up your domain MX record to Zoho</li>
<li>Configure delivery as per guideline mentioned here</li>

39110466,2,39108557,2016-08-23T20:51:54.703,0,"<p>Ok, so I actually figured out a sort of workaround for how to post data to Zoho CRM from Android. First, I am using <a href=""https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/3756"" rel=""nofollow"">HttpAgent</a> to Post the URL. Next, in the HttpAgent.post(), I have the following layout for my URL:</p>

<pre><code>    HttpAgent.post(""https://crm.zoho.com/crm/private/xml/Potentials/
updateRecords?authtoken=myauthtoken&amp;scope=crmapi&amp;id=potentialsid&amp;xmlData=
&lt;Potentials&gt;&lt;row no=""1""&gt;"" + data + ""&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/Potentials&gt;)
</code></pre>

<p>The data variable is a series of StringBuffers with the following layout:</p>

<pre><code>StringBuffer variablename1 = new StringBuffer();
                        if(Checkboxname1.isChecked()){
                            variablename.append(""&lt;FL%20val=\""CRM Field Name\""&gt;CRM Field Value&lt;/FL&gt;"");
                        }
</code></pre>

<p>I need the if statement to check to see if a certain checkbox is checked and if it is, to update the CRM field the checkbox is associated with in my case, others may not need it. I then append them together with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>StringBuffer data = new StringBuffer();

data.append(variablename1.toString() + variablename2.toString()...);
</code></pre>

<p>The data variable is then just plugged into the url where ""data"" has been concatenated. You then just finish it off with a simple </p>

<pre><code>.go(new SuccessCallback() {
                                    @Override
                                    protected void onDone(boolean success) {

                                    }
                                });
</code></pre>

<p>and you are good to go. Make sure to add %20 between ALL spaces that will be going into the URL. I didn't know that at first and it wasn't posting.</p>

<p>This is my total code for all who are wondering:</p>

<pre><code>StringBuffer data = new StringBuffer();

                        StringBuffer variable1 = new StringBuffer();
                        if(checkboxname1.isChecked()){
                            variable1.append(""&lt;FL%20val=\""CRM%20Field%20Name%201\""&gt;CRM%20Field%20Value%201&lt;/FL&gt;""); //Make sure to add %20 between ALL spaces, that threw me off for awhile.
                        }
                        StringBuffer variable2= new StringBuffer();
                        if(checkboxname2.isChecked()){
                            variable2.append(""&lt;FL%20val=\""CRM%20Field%20Name%202\""&gt;CRM%20Field%20Value%202&lt;/FL&gt;"");
                        }

                        data.append(variable1.toString() + variable2.toString());



                        HttpAgent.post(""https://crm.zoho.com/crm/private/xml/Potentials/updateRecords?authtoken=myauthtoken&amp;scope=crmapi&amp;id="" + PotentialID + ""&amp;xmlData=&lt;Potentials&gt;&lt;row%20no=\""1\""&gt;"" + data + ""&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/Potentials&gt;"")


                                .go(new SuccessCallback() {
                                    @Override

                                });

39150859,2,39149917,2016-08-25T16:56:27.890,4,"<p>This is a matter of which versions of <code>vinyl-fs</code> and <code>vinyl</code> you look at on Github and which versions of <code>vinyl-fs</code> and <code>vinyl</code> your local <code>gulp</code> installation is using.</p>

<p>You probably installed gulp from <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>npmjs.com</code></a> by typing:</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install --save-dev gulp
</code></pre>

<p>This currently installs version <code>3.9.1</code> of gulp. You can see which versions of <code>vinyl-fs</code> and <code>vinyl</code> the <code>3.9.1</code> version of gulp depends on by using <a href=""https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ls"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>npm ls</code></a>. Here's the (abbreviated) output from that command:</p>

<pre><code>└─┬ gulp@3.9.1
  └─┬ vinyl-fs@0.3.14
    └─┬ vinyl@0.4.6
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>gulp@3.9.1</code> depends on <code>vinyl-fs@0.3.14</code> and <code>vinyl-fs@0.3.14</code> depends on <code>vinyl@0.4.6</code>.</p>

<p>Here are links to those version on GitHub:</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl-fs/tree/v0.3.14"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl-fs/tree/v0.3.14</a> <br>
<a href=""https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl/tree/v0.4.6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl/tree/v0.4.6</a></p>

<p>As you can see on GitHub <code>vinyl@0.4.6</code> does <strong>not</strong> have a <code>._isVinyl</code> property. Only newer versions like <code>vinyl@1.2.0</code> <a href=""https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl/blob/v1.2.0/index.js#L36"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">have this property</a>.</p>

<p>Since <code>gulp@3.9.1</code> emits vinyl files using <code>vinyl@0.4.6</code> the vinyl files emitted by your gulp installation don't have the <code>._isVinyl</code> property. And that's why the <code>vinyl.isVinyl()</code> function returns <code>false</code> in your example.</p>

<p>The current <a href=""https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/4.0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">development version for the upcoming gulp 4.0</a> uses <code>vinyl@1.2.0</code> . If you were to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/34267286/5892036"">install that version of gulp</a> the <code>vinyl.isVinyl()</code> call in your example would return <code>true</code>.</p>

  <p>When you import an XML schema (.xsd file) or web service definition

  that contains warning messages about unsupported constructs. This is
  because currently Mendix does not support the entire XSD standard. The
  mapping in Mendix is based on entities and attributes, and some XSD
  constructs do not lend themselves easily for this format. The
  following table shows which XSD constructs are supported in Mendix.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you want to use their tool, you cannot use <code>xsd:any</code>.</p>

<p>By definition, any XML can go there; that's the point of <code>xsd:any</code>.

<p>You can set up a custom property of type ""Dynamic"" and call it anything, take ""onConfirmCallback"", for example. Then you can set the function on that custom property:</p>

<p>Code to invoke dialog:</p>

<pre><code>app.pageFragments.ConfirmationDialog.properties.onConfirmCallback = function(param) {
  alert(param); 
};
app.showDialog(app.pageFragments.ConfirmationDialog);
</code></pre>

<p>And then in the onClick for the close button:</p>

<pre><code>app.pageFragments.ConfirmationDialog.properties.onConfirmCallback(""hi"");
app.closeDialog();
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that there are slightly better ways to set up labels than in your example, also using custom properties.</p>

<p>Create custom properties for any widget properties you want to customize, and then bind those custom properties (@properties.propertyName) to the widget property. For example you might have a confirmText property, with the confirm buttons text property boudn to @properties.confirmText.</p>

<p>Then when you invoke your dialog, you can just set those custom properties. Quick modification of your example code using properties for everything:</p>

<pre><code>function confirmationDialog(msg, confirmFunction)
{
  var properties = app.pageFragments.ConfirmationDialog.properties;
  properties.text = msg;
  properties.confirmCallback = confirmFunction;

  app.showDialog(app.pageFragments.ConfirmationDialog);

<p>Note that <code>globs</code> expects a path for the <strong>remote</strong> files on your FTP server. Since your remote files are located in <code>/path/on/my/server/</code> you have to specify that path as your glob:</p>

  var allEmails = [];

  if(results.length &gt; 0){

      allEmails.push(uniqueEmail);      
    }
  }

  return allEmails.join();      

}

<p>Then add a script to the button widget ""onclick"" event that will run the server script and manipulate the returned data. Something similar to this:</p>

  &lt;widget path&gt;.text/value = response;

}

<p>Is your OutSystems environment on-premises or in the cloud? Either way, you need to make sure that this server is able to reach - it as connectivity - to your MySQL database server.

<p>A slightly easier option would be disabling the dropdown (look for the Enabled probably in the property inspector). But that could be confusing for your users since they might think it should be editable.</p>

<p>(Alternatively, you could just remove the field altogether if it's not important to show the relation.)</p>

<p>I think this only answers the ""not editable"" part of your question, if you want it to be pre-filled you either need to do some scripting, or use <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/datasources#relation_datasources"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">relation data sources</a>.</p>

<p>I suggest using relation data sources, so right now you probably have something like:</p>

<p>Instead, you can use <code>widget.datasource.relations.Emp.create()</code>, which will create a new employee which has a relation to the current item in widget.datasource.

<p>Note that none of this stops users from changing the department of an employee, it just changes the UI.

<p>One way of dealing with this kind of errors in OutSystems is inspecting the database itself. There's a system table called ossys_espace. Get your espace id from there. Then query ossys_entity to see which is the physical table name for that entity and check if there's something wrong with it.</p>

<p>There's also the possibility that you've created a table in the past that is causing the error. Check for the entities with the flag deleted set to true in that table.

createDataSource.item.foo = rowDataSource.item.foo;

<p>Edit: It's also worth mentioning that the reason this works in the Editor, but not in Preview/Deployments is the editor is explicitly whitelisted for access (as one of the steps we ask you to do in the documentation), so it doesn't use role permissions for a particular account, while access through your deployments is not explicitly whitelisted in this way, so role permissions are enforced.</p>

<p>If you've already got an Apps Script script, then this should be easy. What you probably want to do is implement a Calculated Model in order to get the results from BigQuery to your application. In short, a Calculated model will let you define a custom schema, and then write Apps Script code to query BigQuery and then create, fill, and return records (which will be very similar to the code you wrote to fill sheets). Once you've done this you can use the calculated model like you would a normal SQL or Drive Tables model.</p>

That said, I think a simple type-class based dispatch based on type is simpler here (since the constraints are non-trivial). With all of the right extensions enabled [1], you just need:</p>

<pre><code>class Tuplify a where
  tuplify :: a -&gt; [(String, String)]

instance Tuplify (Rec Identity '[]) where
  tuplify RNil = []

instance (Show t, KnownSymbol s, Tuplify (Rec Identity rs)) =&gt;
           Tuplify (Rec Identity (s :-&gt; t ': rs)) where
  tuplify (v :*: rs) = (symbolVal (Proxy :: Proxy s), show v) : tuplify rs
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in GHCi:</p>

<pre><code>ghci&gt; tuplify ab
[(""a"",""\""A\""""),(""b"",""1"")]
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>If you really want to try the reifying constraint approach, you'll have to start by declaring a type class and instance for the particular constraint you want:</p>

<pre><code>class ShowField a where 
  showField :: a -&gt; (String, String)                                                                                

instance (KnownSymbol s, Show a) =&gt; ShowField (Identity (s :-&gt; a)) where
  showField (Identity (Val v)) = (symbolVal (Proxy :: Proxy s), show v)
</code></pre>

<p>Then it becomes more straightforward to use <code>reifyConstraints</code> and <code>rmap</code>:</p>

<pre><code>tuplify' :: RecAll Identity rs ShowField =&gt; Rec Identity rs -&gt; [(String, String)]
tuplify' xs = recordToList
            . rmap (\(Vinyl.Compose (Dict x)) -&gt; Vinyl.Const $ showField x)
            $ reifyConstraint (Proxy :: Proxy ShowField) xs
</code></pre>

<p>I imagine something similar is possible with <code>reifyDicts</code>, although I wish there was a variant of it defined using <code>ValuesAllHave</code> instead of just <code>AllHave</code> (then we could bypass declaring a <code>ShowField</code> typeclass and do everything in just a function).</p>

<p>In auto save mode App Maker instantly saves every field, so you have per-field saving granularity. In other words, whenever field's value is changed App Maker sends request to server to save the modification.</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// this code will trigger async call to server to save the modification
// only for this particular field.
app.datasources.MyDatasource.item.MyField = 'My new value';
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Manual Save Mode</strong></p>

<p>With manual save mode there is no easy way to save modifications subsets separately, since whenever you call 'saveChanges' method App Maker will try to persist all modifications made to the datasource. Here are some pretty bad workarounds that <strong>I would not recommend</strong> unless you have no other options:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// Implementation with callback chaining if field save
// order matters. It will work extremely slow.

  ds.item.MyField2 = 'My new value 2';

  ds.saveChanges(function() {
    ds.item.MyField3 = 'My new value 3';

  });
});


// Implementation without chaining. In theory should work
// faster(if it would work at all...)
var ds = app.datasources.MyDatasource;

ds.item.MyField1 = 'My new value 1';
ds.saveChanges();

ds.item.MyField2 = 'My new value 2';
ds.saveChanges();

ds.item.MyField3 = 'My new value 3';
ds.saveChanges();

<p><strong>Server Script</strong></p>

<p>Pretty much same answer as for Manual Save mode, it is doable, but <strong>I would not recommend do it</strong> since performance will significantly degrade.</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// onCreate model event (actually it is onBeforeCreate)

<p><strong>1. I created two Google Drive Table models: PORequests and Items.</strong></p>

<p>PORequests has fields like: PORequest Number, Vendor and the Total*.</p>

<p>*Note: The Total field had to be a String and not a number.</p>

<p>Items has fields like: ItemName, Quantity, Cost and Subtotal.</p>

<p><strong>2. I created a ONE to MANY relationship with the two datasources (PORequests as the owner).</strong> </p>

<p><strong>3. I created a page with two Tables.</strong> </p>

<p>Table 1's datasource = PORequests
Table 2's datasource = PORequests: Items (relation)*</p>

<p>This way if I click PORequest #1 in Table 1 I only see Items associated with that POR.</p>

<p>*Note: I set the Subtotal field to ""non-editable/label"", so no one accidentally changes it manually.</p>

<p><strong>4. Then I created a Client Script:</strong> </p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Locale constant that is used for currency formatting.
 */
var CURRENT_LOCALE = 'en-US';


/**
 * Calculates and formats total cost of all POR items.
 * @param {Array&lt;CartItem&gt;} PORItems - list of user's POR items.
 * @return {string} formatted total cost of all POR items.
 */
function getSubtotalTotal(PORItems) {
    var cost = PORItems.reduce(function(result, item) {
    return result + item.Subtotal;
  }, 0);
  var total = cost + app.datasources.PORequests_HideArchived.item.Tax + app.datasources.PORequests_HideArchived.item.Shipping;
  return '$' + total.toLocaleString(CURRENT_LOCALE, {minimumFractionDigits: 2});
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>5. Then I set the onValueEdit for the Quantity and Cost fields to:</strong> </p>

<pre><code>widget.datasource.item.Subtotal = widget.datasource.item.Quantity * widget.datasource.item.Cost;

var subtotalTotal = getSubtotalTotal(app.datasources.PORequests.relations.Items.items);
app.datasources.PORequests.item.Total = subtotalTotal;
</code></pre>

<p>This tells App Maker to first: multiply the cost by the quantity and put that value in the Subtotal field.</p>

<p>Then it tells App Maker to: use the getSubtotalTotal script to add all the Subtotal values and put THAT value in the Total field of the PORequest datasource.</p>

<p>Hope all that helps someone in the future. </p>

However, you can create a datasource parameter or a page parameter of type List and set your grid datasource equal to this parameter. Then you can use client scripts to manipulate the datasource and read or write it back to your datasource field using string to object conversions and using object to string conversions, however your field must have a string separator like a comma or similar that is used as a parser when converting between string and object.

<pre><code>UpdateContext({ a: 1, b: 2 }); UpdateContext({ c: a + b })
</code></pre>

<p>You can count on the fact that the 'a' and 'b' will be initialized together (without being interrupted). You cannot, however, rely on the fact that the second UpdateContext call will be made before anything happens that may change the values of 'a' or 'b' (such as a timer's OnTimerEnd expression) - although it's very unlikely that this will happen.</p>

<p>For the specific example of timers, if you have two of them with this expression:</p>

<pre><code>Set(globalVarA, globalVarA + 1)
</code></pre>

<p>It's possible (although quite unlikely, especially for this kind of simple operation) that the value of 'globalVarA + 1' will be calculated for the two timers before the internal implementation of the Set function is called to update the value of that variable (in which case the app would ""lose"" one of the increments).</p>

<p>A scenario where a problem is more likely to happen is when you have calls to data sources (which involve network calls that are slower). For example, if you have this expression on two timers:</p>

<pre><code>Set(oldVar1, var1);
Patch(dataSource, record, changes);
Set(var1, oldVar1 + 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Then the likelihood of a race condition happening increases by a lot.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<ul>
<li>Seamless access to data directly from you development environment (browser).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It is hard to maintain such <em>Debug</em> especially when you are actively working on your database structure.</li>
<li>Need to think about security and hide the page from your end users.</li>
<li>Need to keep dedicated datasource(s) for the debug tables/forms, that should have no filters applied (at this time there is no client-side analogue of <code>app.models.MyModel.newQuery()</code> server-side API).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Option 4:</strong> Drag'n'drop way (advanced edition!)</p>

<p>The basic idea is to create a page with dynamic table (to view/edit data) and form (to add records). Using this highly dynamic page will eliminate shortage #1 from the option #3:

<p>You need to have a separate datasource for your dropdown. There are at least three techniques to do this:</p>

<p><strong>Possible values</strong></p>

<p>You can predefine <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/fields#use_default_values"" rel=""noreferrer"">allowed values</a> for your <code>Country</code> field and use them to populate drop down options both in create form and table filtering <code>@datasource.model.fields.Country.possibleValues</code> as you mentioned in question:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/k0fOb.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/k0fOb.png"" alt=""Possible values""></a></p>

<p><strong>Create model for countries</strong></p>

<p>By introducing dedicated <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/relations"" rel=""noreferrer"">related model</a> for countries you can get the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>normalized data (you will not store the same country multiple times)</li>
<li>you'll be able to keep your countries list clean (with current approach there is possibility to have the same country with different spellings like 'US', 'USA', 'United State', etc)</li>
<li>app users when they create new records will be able to choose the country they need from dropdown (opposed to error prone typing it every time for all new records).</li>
<li>your dropdown bindings will be as simple as these:</li>
</ul>

<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>// for names
@datasources.Countries.items..Names

// for options
@datasources.Countries.items.._key

// for value
@datasource.query.filters.Country._key._equals
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Create Calculated Model</strong></p>

<p>With <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/calculated"" rel=""noreferrer"">Calculated Model</a> you'll be able to squeeze unique country values from your table. You server query script can look similar to this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>function getUniqueCountries_() {
  var consumptions = app.models.Consumption.newQuery().run();
  var countries = [];

  consumptions.reduce(function (allCountries, consumption) {
    if (!allCountries[consumption.Country]) {
      var country = app.models.CountryCalc.newRecord();
      country.Name = consumption.Country;
      countries.push(country);
      allCountries[consumption.Country] = true;
    }
  }, {});

  return countries;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However with growth of your Consumption table it can give you significant performance overhead. In this case I would rather look into direction of <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/cloudsql"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cloud SQL</a> and <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/models/cloudsql#sql_calculated_model"" rel=""noreferrer"">Calculated SQL model</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<p>I gave a pretty broad answer that also covers similar situations when number of field options can be unlimited (opposed to limited countries number).</p>

<p>Say for example, you have a model with students data that has three fields; name(string), age(number) and grade(number). On the server script you can write something like this:</p>

<pre><code>//define function to do the data export
function dataExport() {

  //create sheet to populate data
  var fileName = ""Students List "" + new Date(); //define file name
  var newExport = SpreadsheetApp.create(fileName); // create new spreadsheet
  var header = [""Name"", ""Age"", ""Grade""]; //define header
  newExport.appendRow(header); // append header to spreadsheet

  //get all students records
  var ds = app.models.students.newQuery();
  var allStudents = ds.run();

  for(var i=0; i&lt; allStudents.length; i++) {

    //get each student data
    var student = allStudents[i];
    var studentName = student.name;
    var studentAge = student.age;
    var studentGrade = student.grade;

    var newRow = [studentName, studentAge, studentGrade]; //save studen data in a row
    newExport.appendRow(newRow); //append student data row to spreadsheet

  }

  console.log(""Finished Exporting Student Data"");

}

//invoke function to set up the auto export
function exportData(){

  //check if there is an existing trigger for this process
  var existingTrigger = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().getProperty(""autoExportTrigger"");

  //if the trigger already exists, inform user about it
  if(existingTrigger) {

    return ""Auto export is already set""; 

  } else { // if the trigger does not exists, continue to set the trigger to auto export data

    //runs the script every day at 1am on the time zone specified
    var newTrigger = ScriptApp.newTrigger('dataExport')
    .timeBased()
    .atHour(1)

      return ""Auto export has been set successfully!"";
    } else {
      return ""Failed to set auto export. Try again please""; 
    }

  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to delete/stop the auto export, in case you need to, you can write the following on the server script too:</p>

<pre><code>function deleteTrigger() {

  //get the current auto export trigger id
  var triggerId = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().getProperty(""autoExportTrigger"");

  //get all triggers
  var allTriggers = ScriptApp.getProjectTriggers();

  //loop over all triggers.

    // If the current trigger is the correct one, delete it.
    if (allTriggers[i].getUniqueId() === triggerId) {

      ScriptApp.deleteTrigger(allTriggers[i]);
      break;

      //else delete all the triggers found  
    } else {

      ScriptApp.deleteTrigger(allTriggers[i]);

    }

  }

  PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().deleteProperty(""autoExportTrigger"");
  return ""Auto export has been cancelled"";

49117350,2,49103880,2018-03-05T18:41:33.160,1,"<p><strong>Why it happens?</strong></p>

<p>Once you drop a form on a page App Maker will add the following CSS classes to form's widgets:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>app-FormBody</code> for the inner form panel</li>
<li><code>required</code> for all input widgets with input required</li>
</ul>

<p>Also somewhere in App Maker's internals the following CSS rules are defined:</p>



<pre><code>/* Show asterisk only for direct children of 'app-FormBody' panel
   marked with 'required' class */
...
.app-FormBody &gt; .app-TextBox.required &gt; .app-TextBox-Label:after,
... {
  content: "" *"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, when you drop panel inside form body and drag your input inside that inner panel App Maker CSS rules stop working (the widgets are not direct children of <code>app-FormBody</code> anymore).</p>

<p><strong>How to fix it?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you can try to override default App Maker styles</li>
</ul>



<pre><code>/* Note: there is no '&gt;' selector */
.app-FormBody .app-TextBox.required &gt; .app-TextBox-Label:after {
  content: "" *"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure what side effects it can potentially cause...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can explicitly add asterisk in binding</p>

<p><code>@models.MyModel.fields.FieldName.displayName + ' *'</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Please, also keep in mind that App Maker will not automatically add those hidden styles to the widgets you'll add after form is generated.</p>

The cause of the problem is that App Maker prefixes <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/ui/styles"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Global Styles</a> with <code>#app</code>, what breaks your initial variables setup.</p>

<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>/* Design time Global CSS */

  background-color: var(--customColor);

#app :root {
  --customColor: red;
}

#app .app-MyPage-MyPage {
  background-color: var(--customColor);

<p>There is an easy way to cheat App Maker to make variables work:</p>

<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>/* Design time Global CSS

   there is a whitespace OR new line */
 {
  --customColor: red;

}

/* Runtime time Global CSS */
#app {
  --customColor: red;
}

#app .app-MyPage-MyPage {
  background-color: var(--customColor);
}

<p>It will work but there is no guarantee that App Maker will close this door in the future (or fix the original issue).</p>

<p>That is correct -- you need a Gateway to use the PostgreSQL connector today in PowerApps.  The reason we need a Gateway is because we need the user to install the PostgreSQL client for the connector to work.

<p>App Maker's Directory Model is a wrapper on top of <a href=""https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">G Suit Admin SDK's Directory API</a> that exposes just a small subset of its powerful features.

In order to do that we will use <a href=""https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/reference/users/list"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Users.List</a> API method with <code>managerId</code> query parameter (the only one that allows us to query all subordinates down the tree).

<li><strong>managerId</strong>: The ID of a user's manager either directly or up the management chain.</li>
<li><strong>domain</strong>: The domain name. Use this field to get fields from only one domain. To return all domains for a customer account, use the <code>customer</code> query parameter instead. Either the <code>customer</code> or the <code>domain</code> parameter <strong>must be provided</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>viewType</strong>: Whether to fetch the administrator-only or domain-wide public view of the user.

In this answer I'll use <a href=""https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/scatterchart#creating-material-scatter-charts"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google's Material Scatter Chart</a> for reference. Here is a link to its loader library <code>https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js</code></li>

<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>// onAppStart event handler
loader.suspendLoad();

google.charts
      .load('current', { 'packages': ['scatter'] })
      .then(function(){
         loader.resumeLoad();
      });
</code></pre>

<p>The result of the first step will look like this

The model should contain at least to numeric fields (one for x-axis and one for y-axis).</li>
<li>Add container for the chart in can be HTML or Panel widget.</li>
<li>Bind your widget container to the model's datasource</li>
<li>Map datasource's items to chart's <a href=""https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference#DataTable"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DataTable</a></li>
</ol>

<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>// chart container's onDataLoad event handler

widget.datasource.items.forEach(function(item) {
  rows.push([item.X, item.Y1, item.Y2]);
});

data.addRows(rows);

What gives us <strong>2x2=4</strong> custom styles. We also have multiple ways how to implement styles: override them individually for every widget, customize built-it AM style, implement all-new style from scratch or extend AM built in style using CSS class. I will not cover all these options in this answer this time, but let's start at least with something:</p>

<p>Styles for <strong>individual widget</strong>:</p>

  <p>how am I supposed to modify this to change the border color?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Properties of controls in PowerApps can have either constant values, or expressions that reference other properties. For example, your control's hover border color is referencing the border color (I'm assuming of the same control), so if you look at the <code>BorderColor</code> property you'll find some expression that defines the color.</p>

<p>For the specific case of colors, the ""constant"" values you can use are either from the <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-colors"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Color enumeration, or a color name from CSS, or a custom color using the RGBA function</a>.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to set your hover border color to blue, you can use <code>Color.Blue</code> or <code>RGBA(255, 0, 0, 1)</code>.</p>

Using Advance Services API we can achieve the same, here's the answer I've received from <strong>Aliaksei Ivaneichyk</strong></p>

Better to use Planner and Outlook Tasks, and create a group in Microsoft Teams.
In Teams, you can easily add Planner to the tabs, and it at once gives you a To Do option. You can select exactly those people should see the list
(member of the team: all of them , some, or only yourself). It works well on the mobile, too.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing, an integration Planner - Outlook Tasks is not yet implemented

However the ""code"" that you've made are stored as certain Outsystems file types and can be found in the service center. </p>

<p>.OAP Outsystems application (bundle of modules &amp; extensions)</p>

<p>.OML Outsystems module/eSpace</p>

<p>.XIF Extensions (This is c# or java code what you've made yourself)</p>

<p>.OSP Solution (Bundle of modules/espaces and extensions)</p>

<p>In Outsystems you have two options of deploying, via Lifetime or via the service center. How Lifetime works you can find with this link: <a href=""https://www.outsystems.com/videos/lifetime-application-deployment/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.outsystems.com/videos/lifetime-application-deployment/</a>. Summarized Lifetime provides you a user friendly overview to deploy to another environments and checks if there are broken references between modules/eSpaces.</p>

<p>If you want to deploy via the servicecenter, go to the tab ""Factory"". In the menu below the tabs you will see ""applications"", ""eSpaces"" &amp; etc. If you click on one you can publish applications, modules, etc. </p>

<p>What also important is, when you want to publish a application, module, extension or solution to another Outsystems infrastructure (with a different activation code). You need to use the IPP portal of Outsystems since your code is licensed for your own infrastructure.

<h2>Issues and workarounds for this situation :</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>When such large CSV file is converted to Spreadsheet, it cannot directly convert to Spreadsheet, because of both the total number of cells and the size of file. And also when the large file is tried to split, it cannot do it because the blob which can be used at GAS is less than 50 MB (52,428,800 bytes).</p>

<ul>
<li>In order to split such large file, it uses <a href=""https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/manage-downloads#partial_download"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Partial download""</a> of files.get in Drive API.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In my environment, when a CSV file with the size of 100 MB is used for this sample script, when the file is split by 10 MB, about 65 seconds was required to convert a chunk to Spreadsheet. In this case, when the CSV file is completely converted, it is considered that it will be over the limitation time (6 min) for executing GAS.</p>

<ul>
<li>In order to avoid this, it is required to implement the resumable conversion from the large CSV-file to several spreadsheets.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>In order to use this sample script, please enable Drive API at Advanced Google Services and API console.</p>

<h2>Usage :</h2>

<p>When you use this, please modify <code>obj</code> in <code>main()</code> for your situation, and run <code>main()</code>. A sample case is as follows.</p>

<p>It supposes as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>You want to convert the CSV file with the size of 100 MB to 10 spreadsheets.</li>
<li>Size of one chunk is 10 MB.</li>
<li>CSV file is processed by every 3.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this sample case, each <code>obj</code> is as follows. Please input each <code>obj</code> at each run.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>var obj = {fileId: ""#####"", chunk: 10485760, files: 3, start: 0, fileName: ""sample"", number: 1}</code>

<ul>
<li><code>{""nextStart"": ### nextStart2 ###, ""nextNumber"": 4}</code> is returned from <code>createSplitSpreadsheet()</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>var obj = {fileId: ""#####"", chunk: 10485760, files: 3, start: ### nextStart2 ###, fileName: ""sample"", number: 4}</code>

<ul>
<li><code>{""nextStart"": ### nextStart3 ###, ""nextNumber"": 7}</code> is returned from <code>createSplitSpreadsheet()</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>var obj = {fileId: ""#####"", chunk: 10485760, files: 3, start: ### nextStart3 ###, fileName: ""sample"", number: 7}</code>

<ul>
<li><code>{""nextStart"": ### nextStart4 ###, ""nextNumber"": 10}</code> is returned from <code>createSplitSpreadsheet()</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>var obj = {fileId: ""#####"", chunk: 10485760, files: 3, start: ### nextStart4 ###, fileName: ""sample"", number: 10}</code>

<ul>
<li><code>null</code> is returned from <code>createSplitSpreadsheet()</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>By this flow, 10 spreadsheets are created from the CSV file with the size of 100 MB.</p>

<p>If <code>null</code> is used for <code>files</code> in <code>obj</code>, <code>files</code> is automatically calculated. But in this case, the limitation time for executing GAS may be over. Please be careful this.</p>

<p>You'll want to use a condition to save data that's currently in the form if you're connected to the internet otherwise collect it into a temporary collection.</p>

<pre><code>If(ToggleIsConnected.Value,
    //If you are connected to the internet, then write the data to the database.

<p>You can use a Toggle to check the internet connectivity. In the event that you had lost connection, saved data locally, and regained connectivity, the toggle will trigger on and perform the OnCheck actions automatically:</p>

<pre><code>If(!IsEmpty(temporary),
    // If the connection returns and there are records to be written, 
    // then perform these actions:
    ForAll(temporary,
        // For each of the records in the temporary collection, 
        // save their data to a new row in the connected datasource.

        // If writing was successful, copy it to a collection called 'success' 
        // to identify it.
        Collect(success,
            {id: id,
                Record:

                        }
                    )
            }
        )
    );

    If(IsEmpty(Errors(datasource)),
        // If there are no errors with the datasource, 
        // go ahead and clear the entire temporary collection since you're writing.
        Clear(temporary),

        // Otherwise if there is an error, remove only the records that were successful. 
        // Then clear the successful records.
        // Keep records that had an error so they could be attempted later.
        Remove(temporary,Filter(temporary,id exactin Filter(success,!IsBlank(Record)).id));
        Clear(success)

select.onchange = function(e) {
  var value = select.options[select.selectedIndex].dataset.value;

  var input = document.getElementById('customercode');
  input.value = value;

We need to customize it as per our need.</p>

<p>Here are the steps that template will do for you.</p>

<ol>
<li>End user will see all the request he has already made on the home screen. If any. On the right hand side '+' button, user can start a new request.</li>
<li>Here an end user can choose any document from Google Drive/ Team Drive and provide the description for that file and click on 'ADD' button. On the next screen he can provide a list of approvers. Here this template supports both sequential and parallel approvals. i.e. More than one approver can take action at same time or you can have a workflow like approvals where Approver 1 approves first then only Approver 2 gets notified for the action.</li>
<li>Once all approvers are in place users can submit the request and Doc is sent for Approvals with the approvers.</li>
<li>Approvers can Approve/Reject the request with Comments. After all approvals are done workflow is closed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now your second question is somewhat unclear. I think you are referring to Auto Approver names should be added.

widget.root.properties.Timer = new Timer();

runningTimer.start({precision: 'seconds', startValues: {seconds: 0}});

<p>PowerApps works similarly to Excel - you cannot, by an action, change directly the value of a cell (e.g., <code>A1 = 42</code>). But you can make the A1 cell reference another cell (say, <code>=A4</code>), so when you change the value of the cell <code>A4</code>, A1 will be updated as well. The same principle applies in PowerApps - you cannot change the value of a property from an action, but you can update the value that the property references.</p>

51680489,2,51678234,2018-08-03T21:52:18.140,1,"<p><strong>The problem is not due to Zoho Mail: their pop-up contains the correct explanation.</strong></p>

<p>The problem is due to an incorrect configuration of Route 53.</p>

<p>Here are the explanations.</p>

<p>The first step that Route 53 needs to do is registering your new domain by contacting the io TLD registry. There are only two registrar IDs used by Route 53: 468 and 81, depending on the TLD (see IANA Registrar IDs public list: 81 is the registrar of a subcontractor of Amazon, and 468 is directly registered to Amazon). Therefore, we can check that your domain has been correctly registered, or not, to the io TLD <strong>registry</strong> by one of the two <strong>registrars</strong> used by AWS:</p>

<pre><code>% whois -h whois.nic.io trogg.io | grep 'Registrar IANA ID'
Registrar IANA ID: 81
</code></pre>

<p>Since the registrar ID found in the output of the whois request is 81, we can conclude that Amazon has certainly done correctly the first step.</p>

<p>The 2nd step that Route 53 needs to do is sending the names of some AWS DNS servers to the registry, to add NS resource records that delegate that domain from the io domain servers to the AWS servers.</p>

<p>We can check this 2nd step with two different tools: <code>whois</code> and <code>dig</code>.</p>

<p>First, we use whois to look for the DNS records in the database of the io TLD registry:</p>

<pre><code>% whois -h whois.nic.io trogg.io | grep 'Name Server'
Name Server: NS-673.AWSDNS-20.NET
Name Server: NS-1685.AWSDNS-18.CO.UK
Name Server: NS-304.AWSDNS-38.COM
Name Server: NS-1263.AWSDNS-29.ORG
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, we query some io name server for NS records for your domain:</p>

<pre><code>% dig io ns +short | head -1
ns-a3.io.
% dig @ns-a3.io. trogg.io NS | grep trogg.io
; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.10.6 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; @ns-a3.io. trogg.io NS
;trogg.io.          IN  NS
trogg.io.       86400   IN  NS  ns-304.awsdns-38.com.
trogg.io.       86400   IN  NS  ns-673.awsdns-20.net.
trogg.io.       86400   IN  NS  ns-1263.awsdns-29.org.
trogg.io.       86400   IN  NS  ns-1685.awsdns-18.co.uk.
</code></pre>

<p>As expected, the whois database and the io zone contain the same DNS list of four AWS name servers.</p>

<p><strong>Therefore, we can conclude that the io registry has done its jobs correctly.</strong></p>

<p>The following step for Route 53 is to host your domain name on these four name servers, with at least one SOA resource record.</p>

<p>So we check for this task:</p>

<pre><code>% for ns in ns-304.awsdns-38.com. ns-673.awsdns-20.net. ns-1263.awsdns-29.org. ns-1685.awsdns-18.co.uk.
for&gt; do
for&gt; dig @$ns trogg.io soa | grep ANSWER
for&gt; done
;; flags: qr rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
;; flags: qr rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
;; flags: qr rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
;; flags: qr rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the ANSWER count is 0 for each of the four servers.</p>

<p>Therefore, your domain is not hosted by Route 53 servers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What am I missing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is not due to the io TLD servers nor to the Zoho Mail service.
It is only due to your DNS not being correctly configured on Route 53.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it because the domain is .io?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, AWS can register any io domain by means of one of its subcontractors, that is named GANDI.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or maybe I need some other product/service configured in addition to Route 53?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, this is only due to your configuration of Route 53. Your problem with Zoho Mail is not due to Zoho Mail.</p>

<p>You would first need to retrieve the relevant metadata with a metadata api retrieve call using your tool of choice. Here's a sample package manifest for performing a retrieval of the lightning definitions and related resources:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ cat package.xml 
&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;Package xmlns=""http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata""&gt;

    &lt;/types&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;43.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/Package&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Then find the files that contain the text string indicating the component in question, in this case, <code>c:myCmp</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ grep c:myCmp -R .
./aura/myApp/myApp.app:    &lt;c:myCmp /&gt;

</blockquote>

<p>Assuming that I haven't commented that section out, this would show that <code>myCmp</code> is being used in <code>myApp</code>. </p>

<p>I would imagine most of the IDE's out there would provide a similar type of search function. </p>

<p>Another option, if you know for sure the component is being referenced, would be to attempt to delete the component and look at the resulting errors. </p>

51833646,2,51820368,2018-08-14T04:18:53.697,1,"<p>I believe you are getting confused with some terminology in PowerApps. An app in that platform consists of many <em>screens</em>, and you can <em>Navigate</em> from one screen to another. Each screen can have controls that displays data from (possibly) one or more tables. If you want to ""navigate from one table to another"", you need to create a couple of screens, one containing one of the tables, and another containing the other table, and navigate between them.</p>

<p>Another issue that I could find is your expression for the <code>OnSelect</code> property of the arrow:</p>

<pre><code>Filter(Table3,Code in Table2.Club);Navigate(DetailScreen2, ScreenTransition.Fade)
</code></pre>

<p>The first part of that expression is not doing anything - a <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-filter-lookup"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Filter</code></a> function doesn't change any of its parameters; instead it <em>returns</em> a new table (not stored anywhere, just something that can be used as an input for another expression or a control).</p>

<p>If I understand correctly your scenario, you have two tables, and you want the user to select (in the browse screen) items from the first table (<code>table3</code>), and on the second (browse screen) you want to edit a single item from the second table (<code>table2</code>) - using the code from the first selection to find the item you want to display on the second table.</p>

<p>If this is the case, there are a few ways you can go about it. You can have in the <code>OnSelect</code> property of the arrow (in the gallery displaying data from <code>table3</code>) the following expression:</p>

<pre><code>Navigate(DetailScreen2, ScreenTransition.Fade, { selectedCode: ThisItem.Code })
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-filter-lookup"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>Lookup</code> function</a> will return an item from the second table, which then can be displayed in the form for that screen.</p>

<p>Google supports push notifications across many of their APIs. However there are many subtle (and not so subtle) differences between them. Some that leverage webhooks send their data payloads primarily as HTTP headers; for example Drive API and Calendar API. Others mix their payloads across HTTP headers and a POST body(ex: AdminDirectory API). And its gets even crazier, with some APIs utilizing different mechanisms altogether (ex: GMail API leverages Cloud PubSub).</p>

<p>There are nuances to each but your goal is to leverage AdminDirectory push notifications in a GAS app. To do that you need a GAS Web App whose URL can serve as a web-hook endpoint.</p>

<hr>

<h2>STEP 1 - Deploy A Stand-Alone Script As A Web App</h2>

<p>Let's start with the following template script and deploy it as a Web App from the Apps Script Editor menu <strong><code>Publish &gt; Deploy As Web App</code></strong>:</p>

<pre><code>/** HTTP GET request handler */
function doGet(e) {
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(""GET message"");
}

/** HTTP POST request handler */
function doPost(e) {
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(""POST message"");
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>STEP 2 - Verify/Validate Domain Ownership And Add/Register Domain</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>As of August 2019, GAS Web App URLs can no longer be verified using this method. Google Cloud Functions may be a viable</em>
  <em>alternative</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the web app deployed you now have to verify and register the domain of the receiving url, which in this case is also the web app url. This url takes the following form:</p>

<p><code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/exec</code></p>

<p>Technically you cannot own a GAS web app url's domain. Thankfully the App Script Gods at Google do provide a mechanism to verify and register a GAS web app url.</p>

<p>From the Apps Script Editor menu select <strong><code>Publish &gt; Register in Chrome Web Store</code></strong>. Registering a published web app with the Chrome Web Store also validates the URL's domain (no need to fiddle with the search console). </p>

<p>Once validated you need to <a href=""https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/domainverification"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">add the ""domain"" via the Domain verification page in the API Console</a>. The ""domain"" is everything in the url sans the 'exec', so you'll add a string that looks like this:</p>

<p><code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/</code></p>

<hr>

<h2>STEP 3 - Make a watch request</h2>

<p>For this step the AdminSDK/Directory API service should be enabled both for your App Script project and in the API Console. </p>

<p>Create a function that generates a watch request (this can be retooled for other event types):</p>

<pre><code>function startUpdateWatch() {
    var channel = AdminDirectory.newChannel(),
        receivingURL = ""https://script.google.com/macros/s/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/exec"",
        gSuiteDomain = ""[business-name].com"",
        event = ""update"";

    channel.id = Utilities.getUuid();
    channel.type = ""web_hook"";
    channel.address = receivingURL + ""?domain="" + gSuiteDomain + ""&amp;event="" + event;
    channel.expiration = Date.now() + 21600000; // max of 6 hours in the future; Note: watch must be renew before expiration to keep sending notifications

    AdminDirectory.Users.watch(
        channel, 
        {
            ""domain"":gSuiteDomain,
            ""event"":event
        }
    );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that Directory API push notifications have an expiration, the max being 6 hours from starting the watch so it must be renewed periodically to ensure notifications are sent to the endpoint URL. Typically you can use a time-based trigger to call this function every 5 hours or so.</p>

<hr>

<h2>STEP 4 - Update doPost(e) trigger to handle incoming notifications</h2>

<p>Unlike the push mechanisms of other APIs, the Directory API sends a POST body along with its notifications, so the doPost(e) method is guaranteed to be triggered when a notification is sent. Tailor the doPost(e) trigger to handle incoming events and re-deploy the web app:</p>

<pre><code>function doPost(e) {

    switch(e.parameter.event) {
        case ""update"":
            // do update stuff
            break;

        case ""add"":
            break;

        case ""delete"":
            break;
    }

    return ContentService.createTextOutput(""POST message"");

}
</code></pre>

<p>There is one caveat to keep in mind. Push notifications for update events only tell you that the user's data was updated, it won't tell you exactly what was changed. But that's a problem for another question.</p>

<p>Note that there are a ton of details I left out but this should be enough to get you up and running.</p>

<p>Fullcalendar (and most all such programs) can't change things 'on the fly' as you are trying to do - you often will have to set things on the server first and these programs can render, etc. as per the settings you give.</p>

<p>So, in your event, you should set editable = true for the one(s) you want. <a href=""https://fullcalendar.io/docs/event-object"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://fullcalendar.io/docs/event-object</a></p>

<p>You can't (well, not easily - there might be a very round-about way but I don't think it worthy of trying) do this in the 'render' but is simple if you do the check on the server side.</p>

<p>When I say 'server side', I mean 'the data coming into fullcalendar'.  As you have these in ""salesAppointments"" and ""resExceptions"", you may be able to manipulate this a bit in javascript - but, again, not in the fullcalendar section - something like:</p>

First you will either want to recreate your table and in the table creator choose 'Editable' which will automatically place inputs in your table row vs labels. Alternatively you can just replace all your labels with Textboxes, Dropdowns, or whatever your input should be. See the image of the table creator below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2e23d.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2e23d.png"" alt=""Table Creator Editable Fields""></a></p>

<p>Since in my example I used a 'Insert Only' form I moved my 'Create Button' and my 'Clear Changes' button inside the formbody, then set the flow direction of the formbody to horizontal and then matched the spacing of the form fields to the same as my table row and dragged the formbody to be between the tableheader and the tablebody(list) element.

<p>Again you will want to make adjustments to fit your needs such as rearranging where your 'Save' and 'Reset' buttons appear and in manualsave mode you may be able to skip the formbody entirely since your 'Add Details' button should automatically create a new table row anyways which you will then be able to edit directly in the table, you may just need to find it first but generally new rows should just be added on the bottom of your current datasource page.</p>

52825804,2,52814608,2018-10-15T22:59:43.270,2,"<p>Based on your problem description, this is what I've done: <br><br></p>

<p>First, I have set up the models as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Customer: </p>

<ul>
<li>Name</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Project: </p>

<ul>
<li>Name</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Milestone:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><br>Second, I establish the relations as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Customer</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(customer) ONE to MANY (milestone)</p></li>
<li><p>(customer) ONE to MANY (project)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Milestone</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(milestone) MANY to ONE (customer)</p></li>
<li><p>(milestone) MANY to ONE (project)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Project</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(project) MANY to ONE (customer)</p></li>
<li><p>(project) ONE to MANY (milestone)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><br> Third, I created a page, ""milestonePage"", that has the Milestone data model set. Inside that page, I inserted a <strong>table</strong>, and an <strong>insert</strong> form. The page looks like this: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ev6pT.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ev6pT.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>From here, the only thing left to do is to make sure that the bindings of the <strong>Customer</strong> dropdown and the <strong>Project</strong> dropdown are correct. By default, the <strong>Customer</strong> dropdown should have the following bindings:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Options: <code>@datasources.customer.items</code></p></li>
<li><p>Value: <code>@datasource.item.customer</code> </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, the tricky one is the <strong>Project</strong> dropdown. Since you want to display the projects that belong to the selected customer, then you have to do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Delete the bindings for the <strong>Options</strong> and <strong>Value</strong></li>
<li><p>Make sure the new bindings are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Options: <code>@widget.parent.descendants.Field2.value.project</code> (where <strong>Field2</strong> is the <strong>Customer dropdwon</strong>)</p></li>
<li><p>Value: <code>@datasource.item.project</code></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>BONUS:</strong> To avoid any confusion, add this to the <strong>onValueChange</strong> handler of the <strong>customer</strong> dropdown
<code>widget.parent.descendants.Field3.value = null;</code> (where <strong>Field3</strong> is the <strong>Project</strong> dropdown.)</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Pay attention to what Markus Malessa mentioned, about setting up the prefetches since it will be necessary.</p>

<p>You can put this script in the datasource server script or as a function that's called from the datasource server script as Markus suggested.</p>

<pre><code>var usersArr = [];
var pageToken, page;
var conditions = {
    customer: 'my_customer',

52840745,2,52840363,2018-10-16T17:14:05.803,1,"<p>Since you already enabled the Admin Directory API when using the directory model, all you have to do now is to call the sample code from the server script. In a server script, add the sample code:</p>

<pre><code>function listAllGroups() {
  var pageToken;
  var page;
  do {
    page = AdminDirectory.Groups.list({
      domain: 'example.com',
      maxResults: 100,

    });
    var groups = page.groups;

        Logger.log('%s (%s)', group.name, group.email);
      }
    } else {
      Logger.log('No groups found.');
    }
    pageToken = page.nextPageToken;
  } while (pageToken);
}

<p>Then you can simply call the server script by using the following in the client scripting:</p>

<pre><code>google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(function(response){
    console.log(response);
}).withFailureHandler(function(err){
    console.log(err);

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
   $(""h1"").click(function(){
      console.log(""jquery works"");

});
</code></pre>

<p>to the client script, what you did was created a client script under the <strong>SCRIPTS</strong> section of App Maker and then added the code there. If that is so, that is why it's not working.</p>

<p>What you need to do is to use client scripting in the widget event handlers. Each widget has event handlers and the <strong>HTML</strong> widget is not an exception. What I recommend is to add the code to the <strong>onAttach</strong> event handler of the <strong>HTML</strong> widget:</p>

Basically to a void getting this strange error when when modifying an association on a record <code>TypeError: Cannot read property ""data"" from undefined</code> , I did the following:</p>

<p>Loop through the record relation(array) and and popup every record in side it. Then loop through the other records that you want to assign the record relation to ( modify the association ) pushing every element to the record relation. </p>

<pre><code>var length = record[relationNameAsVariable].length;
for(var i=0; i&lt;length; i++){
  record[relationNameAsVariable].pop();
}
</code></pre>

<p>now <code>record[relationNameAsVariable]</code> is empty so do the following:</p>

<pre><code>for(var i=0; i &lt; clientsArray.length; i++ ){
  record[relationNameAsVariable].push(clientsArray[i]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It could be a bug or something else that I'm doing wrong when trying to replace the whole association. I'm not sure. But this works like a champ.</p>

<p>In your Confirmation Popup set a custom property of type Dynamic. For the purposes of this example call the property CallbackFn.</p>

<pre><code>if (typeof widget.root.properties.CallbackFn === 'function') {
  widget.root.properties.CallbackFn();
}
widget.root.visible = false;

<p>For the delete button in your datasource table set the following client script:</p>

<pre><code>deleteItem(widget.datasource);

<p>In your scripts section add a client script or insert the following function under an existing client script:</p>

  popup.properties.CallbackFn = function() {
    datasource.deleteItem();

<ol>
<li><p>Created a model called <strong>questionnaire</strong> with the following fields:<br></p>

<ul>
<li>firstName</li>
<li>lastName</li>
<li>likeIcecream</li>
<li>favoriteMovie</li>
<li>favoriteColor</li>
<li>luckyNumber</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>I added a couple of test records. Then on the server script I added two functions. The first one to send email looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>function sendEmail(recipient, fileUrl, fileName){

  var pdfBlob = UrlFetchApp.fetch(fileUrl).getAs(""application/pdf"");

  MailApp.sendEmail({
    to: recipient,
    subject: ""PDF Email Sample"",
    htmlBody: ""Attached the PDF File"",
    attachments: [pdfBlob]
  });  

}
</code></pre>

<p>The second function to generate the document looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>function emailQuestionnaireAsPDF(questionnaireKey){

  if (app.getActiveUserRoles().indexOf(app.roles.Admins) === -1) {
    throw new Error('You don\'t have permissions to perform this operation');
  }

  var questionnaire = app.models.questionnaire.getRecord(questionnaireKey);

  if (!questionnaire) {
    throw new Error('Questionnaire was not found');
  }

  //Start generating the HTML template
  var htmlData = """";
  htmlData += ""&lt;h1 style='text-align:center'&gt;"" + questionnaire.firstName + ""'s Questionnaire &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;""; //Title of the document

  //Create table start tag
  htmlData += ""&lt;table style='border:none;'&gt;"";

  //Create headers and append to table
  var headers = [""QUESTION"", ""RESPONSE""];
  var hRowStyle = ""background-color:#efefef""; //style for table header row
  var hCellStyle = ""font-weight:bold; padding-top:4px; padding-bottom: 3px; border-bottom:1px solid #bebebe;""; //style for table header cells
  htmlData += ""&lt;tr style='""+hRowStyle+""'&gt;&lt;td style='""+hCellStyle+""'&gt;"" + headers.join(""&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style='""+hCellStyle+""'&gt;"") + ""&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"";

  //Define row cell styles
  var tdSytle = ""border-bottom: 1px solid #bebebe; border-left:0px; border-right:0px; padding-top:7px; padding-bottom: 6px;"";

  //Create table rows
  var rows = [];
  rows.push([""First Name:"", questionnaire.firstName]); // Add firstName
  rows.push([""Last Name:"", questionnaire.lastName]); // Add lastName
  rows.push([""Likes Icecream:"", questionnaire.likeIcecream]); // Add likeIceacream
  rows.push([""Favorite Movie:"", questionnaire.favoriteMovie]); // Add favoriteMovie
  rows.push([""Favorite Color:"", questionnaire.favoriteColor]); // Add favoriteColor
  rows.push([""Lucky Number:"", questionnaire.luckyNumber]); // Add luckyNumber

  //Append rows to table
  rows.forEach(function(row){
     htmlData += ""&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style='""+tdSytle+""'&gt;"" + row.join(""&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style='""+tdSytle+""'&gt;"") + ""&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt;"";
  });

  //Create table end tag
  htmlData += ""&lt;/table&gt;"";

  //Create gooleDriveDoc
  var fileName = questionnaire.firstName + ""'s Questionnaire"";
  var data = Utilities.newBlob("""").setDataFromString(htmlData).setContentType(""text/html"");
  var drvFile = Drive.Files.insert({title: fileName}, data, {convert: true});

  //Mail PDF File
  var recipient = ""email@test.com"";
  var fileUrl = ""https://docs.google.com/document/d/""+drvFile.id+""/export?format=pdf&amp;access_token=""+ScriptApp.getOAuthToken();  
  sendEmail(recipient, fileUrl, fileName);

}
</code></pre>

<p>So, in summary, I've created a google document from an HTML template. Then, I used the download url with an access token to fetch the pdf Blob and attach it to the email. <br></p>

<p>The result is the following: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GEO0T.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GEO0T.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>

<pre><code>@datasource.query.parameters.Column1
@datasource.query.parameters.Query1
@datasource.query.parameters.Parameter1

<p>respectively.</p>

<p>Then your query script needs to be as follows:</p>

  throw new app.ManagedError('Cannot complete query without Parameters!');
}

switch (app.metadata.models.MaintenanceManagement.fields[query.parameters.Field1].type) {

<p>Fortunately, AppMaker has a way of getting the native html elements associated to a widget. You need to use the <code>getElement()</code> method and then you can use the add/remove event listeners methods. So you should change your code from <code>cijCell.addEventListener...</code> to <code>cijCell.getElement().addEventListener...</code></p>

<p>In your case, I'd recommend to save items in batches to speed up the process. I think that saving records in batches of 2000 should be enough. </p>

<p>You can do something like this:</p>

<p>I used a similar solution like the one above to complete the import of 680,000+ records to appmaker. It might need a little bit more of tweaking but you get the idea. As for the latency with the connection, sorry I can't help. Hopefully a Google App Maker engineer can pitch in but as far as I see now, this is your best shot. </p>

Instead of using a <code>dynamic property</code> use a <code>&lt;List&gt;String</code> property. That way you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var jsonObject = {

}

<p>Then, when binding the values to your list, you can use three different labels inside the list row and each label has to be binded to the corresponding value:</p>

<p>Let's suppose we want to be able to change the some settings of your app through its UI or within a microflow. To do this we can create an 'AppSettings' entity with attributes for all the different ""global variables"" that need to be set.</p>

<p>To make it a singleton entity we need to make sure that there is only one object of its kind in the database. To do this it's a common practice to implement a 'GetOrCreate' microflow that retrieves the 'AppConfiguration' object from the database and creates one if there is none yet. </p>

For example if there is a button on the page that triggers a microflow that refreshes the client then it will update the widget. However, if the microflow is triggered by the system (e.g. a scheduled event) then these changes are in a different context. Also if another user triggers a refresh it will only refresh that user’s client. Also if one user is logged in through multiple browsers (i.e. has multiple sessions, it also means that for each session there is a different user context.</p>

<p>The simplest solution in this case would likely be to use an appstore  widget that periodically triggers a refresh on the object displayed in the dataview, such as this one: <a href=""https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/27/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/27/</a> .

I'd recommend you to look <a href=""https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">over this</a> to learn more. So, in appmaker, if you want to apply the background image to a page do this:</p>

<h2>The CSS</h2>

<p>1.) First, select the root widget of the page you are interested.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qNpzH.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qNpzH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>2.) Now, that you have the page selected, let's move to the style editor. Once there, on the <strong>Page Style</strong> section just type a "".""(period, dot) and wait for the suggestions to appear. The first suggestion is what you need, so just press enter or select it with your cursor.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jLzO.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jLzO.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>3.) Now that you have selected the element with a css selector, you can apply styling. For the background, you need to do this:</p>

<pre><code>.app-myTestingPage-myPage {
  background: url(""url-to-picture"");
}
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y8tgy.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y8tgy.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In the above example, <code>url-to-picture</code> represents that, a url to a an image, preferably if it is served over <strong>https</strong>.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>The URL</h2>

<p>I know two ways in which you can get the background image url. The first one is to use any image url you find on the internet or a url hosted in your own server or cdn. The second way is to upload the image to appmaker resources and use that url. If you choose the latter, then do the following:</p>

<p>1.) Go to the app settings.</p>

<p>2.) Click on <strong>Resources</strong></p>

<p>3.) Drop your image file in the respected area or click the button to browse</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gYZq8.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gYZq8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Once the resource finishes uploading, you can click the copy icon to copy the url to the resource and you can use that in your page css as the background url.</p>

56185506,2,56183981,2019-05-17T11:28:25.350,0,"<p>This error sometimes happens because there is an infinite loop going on and this is your case. It is very important that you understand the difference between the <strong>onValueChange</strong> event handler and the <strong>onValueEdit</strong> event handler.</p>

<p>The <strong>onValueChange</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This script will run on the client whenever the value property of this widget changes. The widget can be referenced using parameter widget and the new value of the widget is stored in newValue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>onValueEdit</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This script will run on the client whenever the value of this widget is edited by the user. The widget can be referenced using parameter widget and the new value of the widget is stored in newValue. Unlike onValueChange(), this runs only when a user changes the value of the widget; it won't run in response to bindings or when the value is set programmatically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br></p>

<h2>Why is this happening?</h2>

<p>Since your logic is set on the <strong>onValueChange</strong> event handler, this will be triggered everytime the <strong>dateBox</strong> widget value is changed, even programmatically; Hence, <code>form.otDateBox.value = null;</code> is triggering the logic over and over again. The reason why it is being triggered over and over again is due to your comparison logic:</p>

<pre><code>if(otdate &lt;= pastdate)
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the value of <strong>otdate</strong> has become <strong>null</strong> wich when converted to number <code>Number(null)</code> the value is <strong>0</strong>(zero). The value of <strong>pastdate</strong> is obviously a number greater than zero, eg <strong>1555413900712</strong>. So obviously, zero is less than or equal to 1555413900712 and that is why you are triggering an infinite loop.</p>

<p>So, in summary, there is only one way to fix this. Set the logic inside the <strong>onValueEdit</strong> event handler instead of the <strong>onValueChange</strong>.</p>

<p>First, note that when using <code>query.sorting.YourFieldName.</code> in your query server script, the following options are presented in the code autocomplete - _ascending, _descending, _order, and _priority. When hovering on the _order choice you will note that this is a read-only property and it states that ascending order will return true and descending order will return false. What is not mentioned is that no order on a particular column will return undefined.</p>

<p>So the following code worked for me and returned a console log with the column name and the order, albeit this code does not pick up if there are any relation fields that are sorted:</p>

<pre><code>var query = app.models.Person.newQuery();
query.sorting.Name._ascending();
var fields = app.metadata.models.Person.fields;
for (var i in fields) {
  //if statement first checks column is not a foreign key and that column has sorting 
  if(i.indexOf('_fk') === -1 &amp;&amp; query.sorting[i]._order !== undefined) {
    console.log(query.sorting[i]._order ? 'Column Name: ' + i + ', Order: Ascending' : 'Column Name: ' + i + ', Order: Descending');
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The console would return ""Column Name: Name, Order: Ascending"". Let us know if that is what you are in fact looking for.</p>

<p>I ended up making the whole function <strong>selectedValueChanged</strong>() ""<em>asynchronous</em>"" by using the <strong>setTimeout</strong> trick.</p>

<p>One solution that worked for me was the following:</p>

<pre><code> function selectedValueChanged() {

    var e = document.getElementById(""record_id_select"");
    var value_selected = e.value;
    var CO_picked_record_id = parseInt(value_selected);

    var table_div = tableCreate(data_array,'table_container_1',""Please Enter Quantities"",headerList);
    $('#table_container_1').replaceWith(table_div);

     }

     function selectedValueChangedUP() {

      $('#curtain').show(); 
      loadingSelectedValueChanged(selectedValueChanged);

<p>And now instead of calling <strong>selectedValueChanged</strong>, I call <strong>selectedValueChangedUP</strong>.</p>

<p>What <strong>SetTimeout</strong> does is to execute the function that receives as parameter after a given amount of time. This process is done in an ""<em>asynchronous</em>"" way.</p>

<li>The binding in your follow-up comment -- <code>@datasources.Services.items</code> -- won't work for a multiselect, because it represents the entire set of records in your Services datasource. The binding that Markus suggests is what projects to grab just the names of each of the items.

<li>Pass in values from another datasource, turned into an array. This would be if you're reading the values from a specific field in another record.

<li>Set the values programmatically. This would be if you're doing something else behind the scenes to generate the pre-selected values. So if your Service datasource has six things in it that are potential options, but only some of them should be selected, your script would contain something like this: <code>widget.values = [selection1, selection5, selection6];</code></li>

<p>You'll need to extract that file, and place it somewhere where your Python interpreter can find it.

56582225,2,56577667,2019-06-13T14:00:35.660,0,"<p>Creating a lot of records via client script is not recommended, especially if you loose connection or the app gets closed by mistake. In my opinion, the best way to handle this would be via <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/scripting/server#creating_records"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">server script</a> for two things: First, It's more reliable and second, it's faster. As in the example from the official documentation, to create a record you need to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Assume a model called ""Fruits"" with a string field called ""Name"".
var newRecord = app.models.Fruits.newRecord();
newRecord.Name = ""Kiwi"";  // properties/fields can be read and written.
app.saveRecords([newRecord]);  // save changes to database.
</code></pre>

<p>The example above is a clear example on how to create only one record. To create several records at once, you can use a <code>for</code> statement like this:</p>

<pre><code>  function createRecordsInBulk(){
    var newRecords = [];
    for(var i=0; i&lt;19; i++){
        var newRecord = app.models.Fruits.newRecord();
        newRecord.Name = ""Kiwi "" + i;
        newRecords.push(newRecord);
    }
    app.saveRecords(newRecords);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, you initiate <strong>newRecords</strong>, an empty array that will be responsible for holding all the new records to create at once. Then using a <code>for</code> statement, you generate 19 new records and push them into the <strong>newRecords</strong>. Finally, once the loop is finished, you save all the records at once by using <strong>app.saveRecords</strong> and passing the <strong>newRecords</strong> array as an argument.</p>

<p>Now, all this is happening on the server side. Obviously you need a way to call this from the client side. For that, you need to use the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/scripting/client#call_a_server_script"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">google.script.run</a> method. So from the client side you need to do the following:</p>

<pre><code>  google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(function(result) {
      app.datasources.Fruits.load();
  }).createRecordsInBulk();
</code></pre>

<p>All this information is clearly documented on the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appmaker/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">app maker official documentation site</a>. I strongly suggest you to always check there first as I believe you can get a faster resolution by reading the documentation.</p>

<p>To implement it, I updated the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the date picker - which in my app is called <code>DatePicker1</code> - itself (to change its border to red when there is a problem), set the <code>BorderColor</code> property to <code>If(DatePicker1.SelectedDate &lt; Today(), Color.Red, RGBA(0, 18, 107, 1))</code></li>
<li>In the label behind the picker, set its <code>Visible</code> property to <code>DatePicker1.SelectedDate &lt; Today()</code></li>
<li>In the button that the user would click to perform an action with the selected date, set its <code>DisplayMode</code> property to <code>If(DatePicker1.SelectedDate &lt; Today(), DisplayMode.Disabled, DisplayMode.Edit)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

What would you want to happen if it is not empty? If the expected outcome is for the result not to be sorted, you can have the If expression outside of the SortByColumns:</p>

<pre><code>If(

        Ascending);
    Tabela4)

<p>Notice that there's something strange with the <code>If</code> condition. Tabela4 is a table (i.e., contains multiple records / rows), so <code>Tabela4.finalizado</code> is not a string, it's a table of string values, so the expression above will not work.</p>

56633525,2,56615245,2019-06-17T14:35:50.830,1,"<p>I have found the easiest way to create related items for situations such as yours is to actually import a form with the datasource set to <code>Parent: Child (relation)</code> or <code>Parent: Child (relation) (create)</code>. So in your case the datasource would need to be set to <code>Order: Order_Items (relation)</code>.</p>

<p>You can get this accomplished in two different ways using the form widget wizard:</p>

<p>Option 1:</p>

<ol>
<li>If your page datasource is set to Order_Items, drag your form on your page.</li>
<li>In the datasource selection section, your datasource in the form widget should default to `Inherited: Order_Items'. Click the 'Advanced' button in the bottom left corner, then from the datasources category find Order as your datasource, then select relations in the next field, and then Order_Items in the next field, choose 'Insert only' or 'Edit' form and then the appropriate fields you want in the form.</li>
<li>Now every item that gets created in that form will automatically be a child record of the currently selected record in your Order datasource.</li>
</ol>

<p>Option 2:</p>

<ol>
<li>If your page datasource is set to Order, drag your form on your page.</li>
<li>In the datasource selection section, your datasource in the form widget should default to <code>Inherited: Order</code>. Scroll down in your datasource selection section until you find <code>Order: Order_Items (relation)</code>, then choose 'Insert only' or 'Edit' form and then the appropriate fields you want in the form.</li>
<li>Now every item that gets created in that form will automatically be a child record of the currently selected record in your Order datasource.</li>
</ol>

<p>In your Order model, make sure that the security setting is set appropriately that a user is allowed to create relations of Order_Items in Order. That is the simplest approach in my opinion since you don't have to hard code the parent into your form or client/server scripts. It is automatically based on the currently selected parent, and is essentially doing the same thing that @Morfinismo explained in the client script section.</p>

<p>Then update the data card default value by doing something like:</p>

&lt;lightning:input type=""string"" name=""res"" aura:id=""res"" value=""{! v.rate }"" label=""Result""/&gt;

Finally, the Lightning JavaScript callback from that async method would populate the return value into the <code>&lt;aura:attribute&gt;</code>, and the framework's data binding infrastructure will take care of updating the <code>&lt;lightning:input&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Example code would be (recall that 'query' is a default variable for the current model server script so the subquery needs it's own variable):</p>

<pre><code>var DOTmodelquery = app.models.DOT.newQuery();
DOTmodelquery.filters.email._equals = Session.getActiveUser().getEmail();

<p>Not sure that a relationship between Service and DOT would be the way to go here but you could possibly consider establishing a Province model and then having a relationship between Province-Service and Province-DOT and then try running a query in Service like so <code>query.filters.Province.DOT.email._equals = Session.getActiveUser().getEmail();</code>.

You really don't have a choice here if your users are savvy. As soon as you share an app that has SQL Credentials with them, they can create their <strong>own PowerApp</strong> and reuse the ConnecTION with whatever permissions the SQL User for the ConnecTION has. </p>

<p>One thing I've seen people do is:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/azuread/#check-group-membership"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Add the Active Directory Connector</a> to your PowerApp</li>
<li>Create your own login screen</li>
<li>Check to see if user is part of an AD Security Group via your login screen before they can access the SQL area of the app.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't particularly like this method because the AD Connector doesn't have any way to authenticate users. User just passes it an email address.</p>

<p>This does not mitigate the shared ConnecTION issue noted above, but may give you some piece of mind.</p>

<p>Another option that comes to mind is to only give the PowerAppsSql user Read access to the database. Force the user write to a Sharepoint list instead, then use Flow under <strong>your creds</strong> to Write to the DB (Crazy work around, I know, but I'm trying to help here :) ).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I was asked by Google Cloud Support (""Support"") to provide network traffic info using <a href=""http://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddlercap"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FiddlerCap</a>.  As I am on a linux machine and FiddlerCap is a windows application, I suggested alternatives (eg:<a href=""https://www.wireshark.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wireshark</a>).  It was eventually not required and never provided.</p></li>
<li><p>I noticed that on the <a href=""http://script.google.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google scripts</a> page, when accessing the project in question selecting ""Preview"", it was missing the following OAuth:
<a href=""https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly</a>
The functioning deployed version did not have this missing.</p></li>
<li><p>Still in the Preview, I selected ""Stackdriver (logs)"", which gave me an error that the project had been deleted.  The actual wording was:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Access forbidden</p>

<p>Project XXXX is shut down and scheduled to be deleted.  A project owner can cancel the shutdown on the projects list page.</p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li><p>Clicking on the link in the error ""Go to projects list page"" brought me to a page with the title ""Resources pending deletion"", which did not load a list of projects (but otherwise fully loaded) and would display the spinning wheel in perpetuity.  I attempted this multiple times, including leaving it overnight once.</p></li>
<li><p>Support presumed that I had deleted the GCP project, although I honestly don't/didn't think I had.  I also confirmed that creating new previews did not work, but creating new deployments did.  I also confirm(ed) that this particular App Maker app did not require (eg) a GCP SQL database.</p></li>
<li><p>Support pointed me toward the following website: <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects/undelete"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google undelete project</a> and I was asked to follow these steps (copy-pasted here):</p></li>
</ol>

<p>a. For projectId, enter your project ID. From the screenshot you provided, this is ""XXX (redacted)"" (the quotes are just to emphasise the project ID, you shouldn't enter them.</p>

<p>b. Click EXECUTE.</p>

<p>c. You'll be prompted to grant authorisation, which may be preceded by a prompt to choose your admin account. Please do so.</p>

<p>d. You should receive a 200 response, with an empty body, that is {}.</p>

<p>e. Attempt to access the project via <a href=""https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/settings?project=XXX"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Project link</a> (with the actual project id redacted here).</p>

<ol start=""7"">
<li>The above yielded some strange behaviour:</li>
</ol>

<p>a. undeleteing the project gave it a different name that the App Maker app;</p>

<p>b. I notice that I had 3 other projects all called correctly (the App Maker app name).</p>

<p>c. When asked to reauthorize, I was provided with yet another project name (""Untitled project""), which was different from the correct one and different from the one in para. 7a, above.</p>

<p>d. I then also obtained another error in a new window which read:</p>

<ol start=""401"">
<li>That's an error</li>
</ol>

<p>Request Details
(a bunch of stuff)
That's all we know.</p>

<ol start=""8"">
<li>Support advised that there may be a propagation issue, and that I should wait up to 30 minutes.  I did, and it then worked!  The only weird thing was the project name was wrong, but it was only for the preview, so I didn't really care.</li>
</ol>

<p>If anyone needs additional information, I can PM screenshots I took along the way.</p>

<p>Hope this helps someone!</p>

  <p>Because a table is a collection of other widgets, you can't use the Widget API to interact with a table. However, you can use scripts to manipulate the individual widgets that make up a table.</p>

<p>The above statement makes sense because the amount of rows a table will display depends on the datasource items; i.e., the rows are dynamically created when the widget datasource is loaded in the ui.

In fact you could get rid of that entire form and just incorporate your multiselect widget into your 'Software anlegen' form instead with the same bindings I already outlined. Also make sure to remove the onValuesEdit code that you had associated with your multiselect.</p>

You can of course use another solution which is using server scripting and reloading the datasource item. In order to achieve that, your client script should look similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>var recordKey = widget.datasource.item._key;
var status = ""inside"";
google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(function(){
    widget.datasource.item._reload(function(){
        refreshPanelWithColor();
    });
}).withFailureHandler(function(err){
    console.err(err.toString());
}).updateDesiredRecord(recordKey, status);
</code></pre>

<p>And of course, you need to implement your server script being called from the client. It should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function updateDesiredRecord(recordKey, status){
    var record = app.models.MYMODEL.getRecord(recordKey);
    record.status = status;
    app.saveRecords([record]);
}

<p>I'm not sure what your <code>refreshPanelWithColor()</code> function does but I hope you get an idea of what this solution intends to.</p>

58066774,2,58039038,2019-09-23T16:40:49.577,4,"<p>The solution I'd use for this one definitely involves a field on the record that contains a comma separated string of all the users who should have access to it. I've worked on the following example to explain better what I have in mind.</p>

<p>I created a model and is called <strong>documents</strong> and looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qeqim.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qeqim.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In a page, I have a table and a button to add new document records. The page looks like this: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rf3c8.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rf3c8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>When I click on the <strong>Add Document</strong> button, a dialog pops up and looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bzmzs.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bzmzs.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The logic on the <strong>SUBMIT</strong> button on the form above is the following:</p>

<pre><code>widget.datasource.item.owners = app.user.email;
widget.datasource.createItem(function(){
  app.closeDialog();
});
</code></pre>

<p>That will automatically assign the creator of the record the ownership. To add additional owners, I do it on an edit form. The edit form popus up when I click the <strong>edit</strong> button inside the record row. It looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J5B32.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J5B32.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you can see, I'm using a list widget to control who the owners are. For that, it is necessary to use a <code>&lt;List&gt;String</code> custom property in the edit dialog and that will be the datasource of the list widget. In this case, I've called it <strong>owners</strong>. I've applied the following to the <strong>onClick</strong> event of the edit button:</p>

<pre><code>var owners = widget.datasource.item.owners;
owners = owners ? owners.split("","") : [];
app.pageFragments.documentEdit.properties.owners = owners;
app.showDialog(app.pageFragments.documentEdit);
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>add</strong> button above the list widget has the following logic for the <strong>onClick</strong> event handler:</p>

<pre><code>widget.root.properties.owners.push("""");
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>TextBox</strong> widget inside the row of the list widget has the following logic for the <strong>onValueEdit</strong> event handler:</p>

<pre><code>widget.root.properties.owners[widget.parent.childIndex] = newValue;
</code></pre>

<p>And the <strong>CLOSE</strong> button has the following logic for the <strong>onClick</strong> event handler:</p>

<pre><code>var owners = widget.root.properties.owners || [];
if(owners &amp;&amp; owners.length){
  owners = owners.filter(function(owner){
    return owner != false; //jshint ignore:line
  });
}
widget.datasource.item.owners = owners.join();
app.closeDialog();
</code></pre>

<p>Since I want to create a logic that will load records only for authorized users, then I had to use a query script in the datasource that will serve that purpose. For that I created this function on a server script:</p>

<pre><code>function getAuthorizedRecords(){
  var authorized = [];
  var userRoles = app.getActiveUserRoles();
  var allRecs = app.models.documents.newQuery().run();
  if(userRoles.indexOf(app.roles.Admins) &gt; -1){
    return allRecs;
  } else {
    for(var r=0; r&lt;allRecs.length; r++){
      var rec = allRecs[r];
      if(rec.owners &amp;&amp; rec.owners.indexOf(Session.getActiveUser().getEmail()) &gt; -1){
        authorized.push(rec);
      }
    }
    return authorized;
  }  
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then on the <strong>documents</strong> datasource, I added the following to the query script:</p>

<pre><code>return getAuthorizedRecords();
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IaYYA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IaYYA.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This solution will load all records for admin users, but for non-admin users, it will only load records where their email is located in the <strong>owners</strong> field of the record. This is the most elegant solution I could come up with and I hope it serves your purpose.</p>

  <p><strong>What are the expectations of a Common Data Model data consumer</strong><br>
  In the Common Data Model ecosystem, data consumers are expected to read the metadata and data as the producer described and <strong>not to modify any data</strong> that consumer didn't also produce. If a data consumer wants to extend or modify the data from another data producer, the consumer then becomes a data producer and should follow the best practices of data producers.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What are the expectations of a Common Data Model data producer</strong><br>
  In the Common Data Model ecosystem, data producers are expected to provide sufficient information for a data consumer to understand and parse the data files. A general principle is to make the metadata as rich as possible to simplify the experience for data consumers.</p>

  <p>Both platforms that currently support the Common Data Model also offer data-integration experiences through Power Query Online that allow users to bring in data from a variety of sources, transform it if necessary, and then map it to standard entities in the Common Data Model or create custom entities.

Here are the steps I took to accomplish this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Created a calculated SQL model, called it 'Tables', created one
Field of type string and set the name setting of the field to
'Tables_in_MyDatabaseKey'. Set the datasource query to <code>show
tables;</code>. Created a blank page, created a list widget with
datasource set to 'Tables', created a label widget within the list
row and set binding to <code>@datasource.item.Tables_in_MyDatabaseKey</code>.
This resulted in being able to see the correct table name of my
relation table.</li>
<li>Created an other calculated SQL model, called it 'TableDescription',
created one Field of type string and set the name setting of the
field to 'Field'. Set the datasource query to <code>DESCRIBE
MyDBTableName;</code> (This portion has been edited to change DESCRIPTION to DESCRIBE, thank you to @Morfinismo for pointing out this error). Added another list widget to my newly created page
and set the datasource to 'TableDescription', created a label widget
within this list row and set binding to <code>@datasource.item.Field</code>.
This displayed the correct column names within my table.</li>
</ol>

<p>The corrected SQL query is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
  YEAR(Date + INTERVAL 3 MONTH) AS WaterYear,
  SUM(IF(DATE_FORMAT(Date,'%m') = '10',Water_Use_Gallons,null)) as 'Oct',

<li>The second <code>With</code> calculates the first <em>Monday</em> of the month, since this is what determines the week number in your scenario. It does that by adding the number of days until the next Monday to the first day of the month, which was calculated in the above step. It also retrieves the week number from your table (in my example I called it 'MyTable', you would replace it with the appropriate name in your scenario)</li>
<li>Finally, given the week number and the first Monday of the month, we can add the appropriate number of days to get the desired result.</li>

<p>EDIT: Adding how to also not render parent components/page</p>

<p><a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Controller_Component_Communication"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is some in depth documentation on this</a> but put simply you need to add an attribute to your component with the repeat in it so you can pass in the page parent page/components apex controller for example if your parent page had a apex controller with the name <code>MyApexController</code>...</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;apex:attribute name=""controller"" description=""parent page controller"" type=""MyApexController"" assignTo=""{!pageController}""/&gt;

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>public class MyApexController {
  public boolean hasAccounts {get; set;}

  public List&lt;Account&gt; accounts {get; set;}
  public MyApexController pageController {get; set;} //this will get set by apex:attibute
  public MyComponentController(){
    if(getAccountsEmpty()){
      this.pageController.hasAccounts = false; //no accounts let parent page know
    } else {
      this.pageController.hasAccounts = true;
    }
  }

public boolean getAccountsEmpty(){
  return this.accounts == null || this.account.size() == 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then on your parent page or component just add a similar attribute to your child component 
Parent page tag
<code>&lt;apex:page rendered=""{!hasAccounts}""&gt;</code> </p>

<p><code>&lt;apex:component rendered=""{!hasAccounts}""&gt;</code></p>

<ol>
<li>Set up a separate datasource under the Department model. Change the default 'Query Builder' to 'Query Script' and add a parameter of type 'list(number)' or 'list(string)', this should match your Primary Key field type. Uncheck the 'auto load' option.</li>
<li><p>In your 'Query Script' portion enter the following code:</p>

<p>query.filters.Id._in = query.parameters.YourParameter;</p>

<p>return query.run();</p></li>
<li><p>Go to your Employees datasource that is supposed to generate your table and find your 'On Load' client script section. In this section enter the following code:</p>

<p>var departmentsDs = app.datasources.YourDepartmentsDs;</p>

<p>departmentsDs.properties.YourParameter = datasource.items.map(function(deptIds) {return deptIds.DeptID;});</p>

<p>departmentDs.load();</p></li>
<li><p>Now go the page that contains your table. If you have not already create a label widget do so now. In this label widget for the text binding enter the following:</p>

<p>@datasources.YourDepartmentsDs.loaded &amp;&amp; (@datasources.YourDepartmentsDs.items).map(function(Id){return Id.Id}).indexOf(@widget.datasource.item.DeptID) !== -1 ? @datasources.YourDepartmentDs.items[(@datasources.YourDepartmentsDs.items).map(function(Id){return Id.Id}).indexOf(@widget.datasource.item.DeptID)].DeptDescription : 'Unable to retrieve Dept Description'</p></li>

<p>The multi-select widget is bound to a parameter in the datasource.

  var toppingList = [];

  if(query.parameters.topingList){
    query.parameters.topingList.forEach(function(e,i){
        var newRecord = recordFactory.create();
        newRecord.Name = e;
        newRecord.Amount = 0;
        toppingList.push(newRecord);
    });

The client function can be called on the button property called 'onClick'. 
So, on 'onClick' input you should reference the function you'll like to execute: NewProject();</p>

<p><strong>Client Script</strong></p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>function NewProject() {
  google.script.run
    .withFailureHandler(function(error) {
    console.error(error)
  })
    .withSuccessHandler(function(result) {
    console.info(result)
  })

  var folder = DriveApp.createFolder(Session.getActiveUser().getEmail()+' Folder');
  folder.addEditor(Session.getActiveUser().getEmail());
  return(folder.getUrl());
}
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever you create a folder on drive, it's created with the most limited access: only the Drive account owner can access this folder.</p>

<p>So, on the first line this is what we are doing: we are creating a folder named 'Y folder' that is only accessible by the Drive account owner.</p>

<p>The second line <a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/drive/folder#addEditor(String)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">adds an Editor</a> to that newly created folder, to make it so we only have to put it's mail in between the brackets.</p>

<p>To make this work as you wish the app has to run as Developer's account, this is set up on App Settings, just be aware the app runs on behalf of the Developer account.</p>

59054958,2,59053286,2019-11-26T16:05:31.623,1,"<p>As you probably know, Salesforce SOQL doesn't have explicit JOIN clauses. It does that for you implicitly based on related object fields. That means you'll have to query <code>Account_Enrollment__c</code> and traverse the fields to get the related <code>Enrollment_Program__c</code> Lookup relationship.</p>

<p>Another problem is Salesforce only performs joins based on primary and foreign keys, so the <code>EP.Crop_Year__c = AE.Crop_Year__c</code> in your query won't work.</p>

<p>So, with that said, you can try this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Enrollment_Program__c, Enrollment_Program__e.Name,
 Enrollment_Program__r.Crop_Year__c, Enrollment_Program__r.Targeted_Enrollment_Segments__c,
 Enrollment_Program__r.Description__c, Enrollment_Program__r.Start_Date__c,
 Enrollment_Program__r.End_Date__c 
FROM Account_Entrollment_Program__c WHERE Account__c = 'zyz'

<pre><code>AND Crop_Year__c=:year AND Enrollment_Program__c.Crop_Year__c=:year
</code></pre>

<p>Some details on the queries:
The <code>__r</code> suffix is how you get the lookup object addressed in the query. If you are interested only in the id, you can use <code>__c</code>.
The <code>:year</code> is how you pass the parameter <code>year</code> to the query. If you want to append it as text you can just use <code>... Crop_Year='+ year + '</code>.</p>

<p>Here is the response from the Google development team posted on Google Issue Tracker: <a href=""https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/145345198"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/145345198</a></p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's great to hear your up and working again!  We are aware of this issue and are working through a longer term fix.  The specific bug appears to be related to some changes made in the Google Cloud session policy control that may have rolled out to your domain recently interacting with AppMaker in a way that was not expected.  We've spent time diagnosing the underlying issue and we beleive we know the root cause.  I suspect your domain admin did a version of the workaround below.</p>
  
  <p>Without getting too far into the details, the specific bug is that for a Deployer of an AppMaker application, if the Google Cloud Session policy is set with any expiration time, the returned token AppMaker sees is invalid, triggering a loop in AppMaker trying to generate a valid security token.  Historically, these session tokens never expired but recently there was  beta feature launch that allowed domain admins to set them to expire.  We strongly suspect your domain recently set this expiration policy explicitly and that's what is causing the bug.</p>
  
  <p>The good news is that these policies are overridable per Organizational Unit and we have tested that OUs which have the original classic Never Expire setting do, in fact, allow AppMaker to work.</p>
  
  <p>My suspicion is that your domain admin has reverted recent, local changes to your organizational policy under the admin.google.com console, specifically under Security > Google Cloud session control (Beta).</p>
  
  <p>If this happens again, here the workaround we would recommend.  Note you don't need to do this if you're currently up and working. You will need the help of someone with admin.gogole.com powers, specifically User and Organizational Unit powers at your organization. It is a slight increase in security risk but it restores some classic behavior that was standard until recently.</p>
  
  <p>The summary of the workaround is to override the Google Cloud session control expiration setting such that individuals who need access to AppMaker deployments can have it.  To mitigate systemic security risk, this is best done by creating a limited purpose Organizational Unit with just that setting different than the parent OU settings.</p>
  
  <p>The workaround is to:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Contact someone in your domain with Admin powers for your Google for Business license.</li>
  <li>Have your admin proceed to <a href=""https://admin.google.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://admin.google.com</a>.  The actions below need to be performed by a domain admin.</li>
  <li>Under the Users section, identify the specific user account that needs the ability to deploy AppMaker Apps.</li>
  <li>Identify the Organizational Unit of that Appmaker dev user and make a note of it.</li>
  <li>Under the Organization Units settings, locate the Organization Unit you identified above.</li>
  <li>Create a new Organization Unit underneath that user's current Organizational Unit with some descriptive identifying it as special w.r.t AppMaker. So for Developers, make something like DevelopersWhoAreAlsoAppMakerDevs.</li>
  <li>Back under the Users tab, locate the user from step 3.  Move this user into the new Organizational Unit you've just created. This change can take a while to propagate.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>-Interlude- At this point, you've made a new Organizational Unit for just that individual and added them to it.  You can certainly add multiple people to that OU, especially if they're already in the same parent OU.  Use your discretion as to what amount of Organizational rework you wish to pursue.  You may not be using OUs at all or you may decide to just turn off this control for the whole domain. It's up to you.</p>
  
  <ol start=""8"">
  <li>Under admin.google.com's Security settings, locate the Google Cloud session control (beta) settings.</li>
  <li>Under this panel, from the dropdown menu on the left, locate the Organization Unit you just created.</li>
  <li>Be sure to select ONLY the OU you intend to change.</li>
  <li>Change the ""Google Cloud Console and Google Cloud SDK session control"" from expiring to ""Session Never Expires"".</li>
  <li>Save your changes.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>The account you selected in step 3 should now be able to deploy AppMaker apps.</p>
  
  <p>It appears this OU change is only necessary for the deployer of an AppMaker app, not an individual user.  Note also that if you have multiple AppMaker developers who all have different current OU settings, you may need to create multiple daughter OUs to avoid a sudden radical shift in OU settings for an individual account.</p>

59380379,2,59371835,2019-12-17T18:50:20.530,0,"<p>To answer your first question, you may preload a page datasource by using the app startup script. Basically the loader needs to be paused, then the datasources loaded and finally resume the loader. To achieve that, in your app go to <strong>Settings -> App Settings -> App startup script</strong>, and add the following:</p>

<pre><code>loader.suspendLoad();
app.datasources.MYDATASOURCEONE.load();
app.datasources.MYDATASOURCETWO.load(function(){
    loader.resumeLoad();
});
</code></pre>

<p>To answer your second question, you may want to use the following CSS or something similar to achieve what you need:</p>

<pre><code>/* Changes the slider color when the value is false*/
.customCheckbox&gt;input:not(checked){
  background-color: red; //apply color here
}

/* Changes the slider color when the value is true */
.customCheckbox&gt;input:checked{
  background-color: blue
}

/* Changes the slider round button color when the value is false */
.customCheckbox&gt;label:after{
  background-color: orange;
}

/* Changes the slider round button color when the value is true */
.customCheckbox&gt;input:checked+label:after{
  background-color: green;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then all you have to do is apply the <strong>customCheckbox</strong> style to the widget list of styles in the Property Editor.</p>

However, I can make some guesses at where you could look, based on the error text. Since the error is stated as being in an ACTION and a callback, this suggests that you are using a callback somewhere in your component's controller. This is commonly used to communicate with the Apex Controller class. So I would start by looking there.</p>

<p>Cannot read property '' of undefined is your next clue. The ""undefined"" is probably a JavaScript variable that is not being properly set in your callback. This could be because of scoping issues, or it could be a problem with a custom namespace if you have a different namespace on the environment from the one you developed on.</p>

However, Flow Bot is a general bot, and doesn't have a way to route the response back to your individual Flow, and specifically to the instance of the Flow. Thankfully, this is changing - see <a href=""https://poszytek.eu/en/microsoft-en/office-365-en/powerautomate-en/register-response-from-custom-adaptive-cards-sent-from-power-automate-to-teams/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for information.

<ol>
<li>Wait till Feb for the new feature</li>
<li>Create your own Bot to send the cards from, and handle the responses - there are a few small tricky parts here as you need to send the initial message on a schedule, so you'd be using something called ""pro-active messaging"", but it's not too complex and something there's good guidance on here in Stack Overflow (I've myself answered a few questions recently on it so can help more if you go this route)</li>

<p>The only difference was that I added a batch size of 10.  It [nevertheless] returns the correct number of rows in the database...</p>

<p>I got the [original] code working as well, by similarly changing the batch size to a smaller number [rather than -1 to retrieve all records].  It turns out that retrieving <em>all</em> records is not necessary to get a correct value for this totalCount field:</p>

<pre><code>local!countOfRows: a!queryEntity(
    entity: cons!MY_DATABASE_TABLE_DS,

<p>In actual fact, setting the batchsize to 0 [for this application] is the best option since this gets the metadata (including the totalCount) without actually wasting any processing time retrieving the rows of data (which aren't used in this instance) - thereby increasing the performance (Thanks Mike Schmitt for the tip on this one).</p>

First I collected the Option Sets from CDS, and added a column to indicate the source name, for reference. This could easily be combined into a single collection, and then filtered later but I was thinking simple.</p>

<pre><code>ClearCollect(colOptionSet1,AddColumns(Choices('Ownership (Accounts)'),""appSource"",""Ownership"")); 
ClearCollect(colOptionSet2,AddColumns(Choices('Preferred Method of Contact (Accounts)'),""appSource"",""Preferred Method""));

Then added a List control with Items equal to</p>

<pre><code>If( Radio1.Selected.Value = ""SomeValueA"", colOptionSet1, Radio1.Selected.Value = ""SomeValueB"", colOptionSet2 )

<p>You may need to use the right-side property pane to toggle between Value and ""appSource"" (from collections above), but this did allow me to toggle between two separate Option Set fields in a single list.</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>app.use(bodyParser.json());

<p>This parser will add the <strong>parsed</strong> (object) content of a request's body to the <code>body</code> property of the first <code>req</code> parameter of your route handler <code>(req, res) =&gt; { ... }</code>.</p>

<p>The hash of your webhook, however, is calculated based on the <strong>raw</strong> (string) payload. While you could use <code>JSON.stringify</code> to convert your parsed body back to a string, this may result in inconsistencies with the original raw payload.</p>

<p>For example, if your currency is <code>Euro</code>, Zoho will pass the encoded <code>""\u20a""</code> as the value for <code>currency_symbol</code>. However, if you use <code>JSON.stringify</code> to convert your parsed body back to a string, you'll find that it produces the unencoded <code>""€""</code> instead. And because this results in both strings not being identical, they will not produce the same hash.</p>

<p>Without direct access to the raw body, it is very difficult to detect precisely what's the difference between the original raw body &amp; the result of your <code>JSON.stringify</code> and thus how the latter should be transformed for it to be in the same format as the original raw body. The simplest way to overcome this, is to use the <code>verify</code> method of your parser, to add the raw body to eg. the <code>rawBody</code> property of the first <code>req</code> parameter of your route handler, as described <a href=""https://flaviocopes.com/express-get-raw-body/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in this article</a> :</p>

<p>In the meantime, the way I typically do this is by splitting records based on the characteristic that delineates them. In this case, you can use <code>gather_object()</code> on the parent object to get the same effect as <code>enter_object()</code>, and then use <code>filter</code> / <code>bind_rows</code> to treat the rows differently.</p>

<p>Ideally <code>bind_rows()</code> would work better in the pipe here... that is something I would like to see as an improvement for <code>dplyr</code> <a href=""https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/4988"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Issue here)</a>!

<p>Query string parameters are secured over <code>https</code>.  Its a common misconception, where people think whole url is open in plain text in transmission. When a request is made to an <code>https</code> url, first it establishes a Secure Tunnel to <code>[instance-url].my.salesforce.com</code> then transmits the rest of the url and any other data over the secure tunnel.</p>

<p>If you're worried about some man in the middle attack sniffing out the SSN from your query string, don't. One downside is, if you are accessing this url from a browser instead of a programmatic call, then there is a chance for browser to stored/cache for history or auto complete, then it won't be so good.</p>

<p>But I doubt if you would be able to do this via browser, as salesforce requires a bearer token set in Authorization header and there is no easy way that I know of to set headers while typing the url in the browser or clicking a link.</p>

<p><code>Attachment</code> and <code>Document</code> objects have exactly same API names, you can view their definitions in <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_objects_attachment.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SOAP API definition</a> or in REST API explorer (there was something which you can still see in screenshot in <a href=""https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/292654/using-salesforce-api-explorer-for-documenting-apex-rest-services"">here</a>, seems to be down now, maybe they're moving it to another area in documentation...)</p>

<p>The Files (incl. ""Chatter Files"") are stored in <code>ContentDocument</code> and <code>ContentVersion</code> object. The name is unexpected because long time ago SF purchased another company's product and it was called ""Salesforce Content"". In beginning it was bit of mess, now it's better integrated into whole platform but still some things lurk like File folders can be called Libraries sometimes in documentation but actual API name is <code>ContentWorkspace</code>. The entity relationship diagram can help a bit: <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_erd_content.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_erd_content.htm</a></p>

<p><code>ContentDocument</code> is a header to which many places in SF link (imagine file wasting space on disk only once but being cross-linked from multiple records). It can have at least 1 version and if you need to update the document - you'd upload new version but all links in org wouldn't change, they'd still link to header.</p>

<p>So, how to use it? </p>

<p>It should give you a good idea which classes/triggers are least covered. Some of these will be quick wins, time spent on creating/improving their tests will give you best results in oveall coverage.

<p>(there's a chance your sandbox is outdated and somebody created validation rules, required fields etc straight in production without deploying... that's why I asked to compile &amp; run all tests in prod)</p>

<p>If there are classes/methods that aren't used anymore and it'd be safe to delete them - you can't do it with changeset, you need a special destructive deployment. For now you could comment them out and deploy that version. Just check if this is beneficial for you (I mean of course it's good to get rid of old code, easier maintenance... but if it happens to be well covered with tests you'll shoot yourself in the foot)</p>

<p>In Power Apps, you can use the function <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-char"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Char(10)</a> to add a new line to a string. So if you have a string variable and a collection with values, you can use something like the expression below:</p>

<pre><code>Set(testString, ""A"");
Collect(testArray, ""B"", ""C"");
Set(result, Concat(testArray, testString &amp; Value &amp; Char(10)))
</code></pre>

<p>In Power Automate, it's not as simple, but I've found one alternative at <a href=""https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Building-Flows/How-can-you-enter-a-Newline-into-a-string/td-p/102447"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this community post</a> where you can use the expression below to have a new line character:</p>

<p>So the only difference would be that you want to set <code>OwnerId</code>, possibly also <code>CreatedById</code> as that user. You can set Owner always as long as the owner is an active user. ""Created By"", ""Last Modified By"" are audit fields, normally not editable. If the owner is inactive or you really want to set ""Created By"" - you can. But you have only 1 shot at this, audit fields can be set only on insert. After that every update is managed by SF.

<p>Now... this isn't always needed. OK, you will recreate the file but all links to it (from other records, from chatter posts, libraries) will be lost. It's in <code>ContentDOcumentLink</code> and if you delete the document - they cascade delete. You might not have info or permissions to recreate all the links.</p>

<p>Your first line of defense could be checking whether file can be restored from Recycle Bin. It can't be done in pure REST API but you could use SF SOAP API or write an Apex service that would try to do that for you.

<p>If they cannot send any special headers (it'd have to be unauthenticated connection to SF) - maybe you could make a Visualforce page, expose it as Site and then page's controller can do whatever you need.

<p>If none of these work for you - does the url have to ping back to Salesforce. Maybe you have control over another server that can accept unauthenticated requests like that and have that one then call SF. Bit like a proxy. You could even set something up fairly easily on Heroku.</p>

<p>Last but not least. This would be extremely stupid but if all else fails - in a sandbox enable Web-to-Case or Web-to-Lead and experiment with these. At the end of the day they give you an url you can POST to and pass a form with data. I think it'd have to be <code>Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> and if you mentioned JSON they're likely to send it as <code>application/json</code> so might not work. If it works - you could maybe save the payload in Description field of Cases (special record type maybe?) and do something with it. I'm seriously not a fan of this.</p>

<li>or you create a lookup field <code>00_lkp_UserSubmittingForm</code> I say lookup and not plain text field. This lookup field will have relationship with contact.

61648046,2,61647756,2020-05-07T00:59:55.243,0,"<p>We aim to extract information from SF via its REST API in order to generate a report in Word format. To to so we need to run queries into the SF custom objects that contain the relevant information. Typically, we are looking to get this information from a collection of custom objects.</p>

<p>One of the custom fields contains an RTF field which contain links to the relevant images. These images are displayed when the objects are viewed in the SF UI. 
There are several entries in both StackOverflow and Salesforce:StackExchange regarding this topic. Many of these entries discuss Apex methods. The ones that discuss retrieving the images via the REST API did not allow me to be successful.</p>

<p>An entry in the SF REST API developer guide <a href=""https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/resources_sobject_rich_text_image_retrieve.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> instructs us how to achieve this: 
send a request to the REST API via a GET as follows:</p>

<pre><code> /vXX.X/sobjects/SObjectName/id/richTextImageFields/fieldName/contentReferenceId 
</code></pre>

<p>The trick here is to determine what is the SObjectName, the id, the fieldName and the contentReferenceId.
We can get the names from the SF database schema we are working with. Fortunately, we can get the IDs from the embedded links in the RTF field.</p>

<p><strong>IDs</strong></p>

<p>The embedded links in the RTF field take the following form:</p>

<pre><code>https://[someInternalSalesforceURL].force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=a0Y3l00000G31DT&amp;feoid=00N1N00000F14uz&amp;refid=0EM3l0000039EK0
</code></pre>

<p>There are three IDs in this link:</p>

<ul>
<li>eid: entity ID</li>
<li>feoid: field entity ID</li>
<li>refid: contentReference ID</li>
</ul>

<p>We need to use the eid and the refid to contruct the request to the SF REST API as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>id = eid</li>
<li>contentReferenceId = contentReference ID</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example above:</p>

<pre><code>/vXX.X/sobjects/SObjectName/a0Y3l00000G31DT/richTextImageFields/fieldName/0EM3l0000039EK0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Names</strong></p>

<p>The next step is to review your database schema and work out the SObjectName and the fieldName. The SObjectName is the Name of the custom object that contains the RTF field. Say: myObject__c
The fieldName obviously is the name of the RTF field: say myRTFfield__c
The request to SF then works out to be:</p>

<pre><code>/vXX.X/sobjects/myObject__c/a0Y3l00000G31DT/richTextImageFields/myRTFfield__c/0EM3l0000039EK0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Retrieving the image</strong></p>

<p>Before sending this to SF you need to prefix it with your salesforce instance URL and you need to articulate the REST API version, e.g. v48.0</p>

<p>Sending this as a GET to SF, I am an R user, returns an object that contains the image as data (in the R case: a matrix). This data object can be converted to an image and saved as a PNG file.</p>

<p><strong>Assumptions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You are are authorised by the SF API and received an access token or SessionID and an instance_url.</li>
<li>You have code that sends a query to SF which returns the object with the relevant RTF field.</li>
<li>you have retrieved the embedded link(s) from the RTF field and peeled the eid and refid from the link.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sample R code</strong></p>

<p>In R this looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>library(httr)
library(png)
request_headers &lt;- c(""Accept"" = ""application/json"", 
                     ""Content-Type"" = ""application/json"",
                     ""Authorization"" = paste0(""Bearer "", access_token))
url &lt;- ""/services/data/v48.0/sobjects/myObject__c/a0Y3l00000G31DT/richTextImageFields/myRTFfield__c/0EM3l0000039EK0""
url &lt;- paste0(instance_url, url) 
result &lt;- GET(url, add_headers(request_headers))

First, you want to make sure SQL can do a simple comparison when selecting rows, so you'll start by calculating a string to match your date on since your [Date] field is a string not a date.</p>

<p>Second, calculate the minutes in your shift (either 540 for a full shift or scaled down to 0 at 7 AM exactly) ahead of time so you aren't calculating minutes in each row.</p>

<p>Third, when summing for operators, use a simple sum on the minutes and calculate efficiency from that sum and your pre-calculated shift so far minutes.</p>

<p>One note - I'm casting the minutes-so-far as FLOAT in my example, maybe not the best type but it's clearer than other decimal types like DECIMAL(18,6) or whatever. Pick something that will show the scale you want.</p>

<p>My example uses a Common Table Expression to generate that date string and minutes-so-far FLOAT, that's nice because it fits in a direct query, view, function, or stored procedure, but you could DECLARE variables instead if you wanted to. </p>

<p>By filtering with an INNER JOIN on the [Date] string against the pre-calculated TargetDate string, I make sure the data set is pared down to the fewest records before doing any math on anything. You'll definitely want to INDEX [Date] to keep this fast as your table fills up.</p>

<p>All these together should give a pretty fast query, good luck </p>

<pre><code>with cteNow as ( --Calculate once, up front - date as string, minutes elapsed as FLOAT (or any non-integer)

                    --4PM in UTC-5, expressed in minutes
            THEN CONVERT(float,(16-7)*60) --minutes in (4 PM-7 AM) * 60 minutes/hour
        ELSE --Assume nobody is running this at 6 AM, so ELSE = between 7 and 4
            CONVERT(float,60*DATEPART(HOUR, GETUTCDATE()) + DATEPART(MINUTE, GETUTCDATE()) - ((7+5)*60))
             --Minutes since midnight minus minutes from midnight to 7 AM, shifted by 
             --UTS offset of 5 hours
        END as MinutesToday --Minutes in today's shift so far
        , FORMAT(DATEADD(HOUR,-5,GETUTCDATE()),'MM/dd/yyyy') as TargetDate --Date to search for

<h2>Usage:</h2>

<p>Please do the following flow.</p>

<h3>1. Create new project of Google Apps Script.</h3>

<p>Sample script of Web Apps is a Google Apps Script. So please create a project of Google Apps Script.</p>

<p>If you want to directly create it, please access to <a href=""https://script.new/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://script.new/</a>. In this case, if you are not logged in Google, the log in screen is opened. So please log in to Google. By this, the script editor of Google Apps Script is opened.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare script.</h3>

<p>Please copy and paste the following script (Google Apps Script) to the script editor. This script is for the Web Apps.</p>

<pre><code>function doGet(e) {
  const path = e.pathInfo;
  if (path == ""filename.txt"") {
    const sampleTextData = ""sample"";
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(sampleTextData).downloadAsFile(path);
  }
  return ContentService.createTextOutput(""Wrong path."");
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>In order to retrieve the value of <code>fileName.txt</code> in <code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/APP_ID/exec/fileName.txt</code>, please use <code>pathInfo</code>.

<ul>
<li>For example, when you check <code>e</code> of <code>doGet(e)</code> by accessing with <code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/APP_ID/exec/fileName.txt</code>, you can retrieve <code>{""contextPath"":"""",""contentLength"":-1,""parameter"":{},""parameters"":{},""queryString"":"""",""pathInfo"":""fileName.txt""}</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In this case, the GET method is used.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Deploy Web Apps.</h3>

<ol>
<li>On the script editor, Open a dialog box by ""Publish"" -> ""Deploy as web app"".</li>
<li>Select <strong>""Me""</strong> for <strong>""Execute the app as:""</strong>.

<ul>
<li>By this, the script is run as the owner.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Select <strong>""Anyone, even anonymous""</strong> for <strong>""Who has access to the app:""</strong>.

<ul>
<li>In this case, no access token is required to be request. I think that I recommend this setting for your goal.</li>
<li>Of course, you can also use the access token. At that time, please set this to <strong>""Anyone""</strong>. And please include the scope of <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly</code> and <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive</code> to the access token. These scopes are required to access to Web Apps.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Click ""Deploy"" button as new ""Project version"".</li>
<li>Automatically open a dialog box of ""Authorization required"".

<ol>
<li>Click ""Review Permissions"".</li>
<li>Select own account.</li>
<li>Click ""Advanced"" at ""This app isn't verified"".</li>
<li>Click ""Go to ### project name ###(unsafe)""</li>
<li>Click ""Allow"" button.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Click ""OK"".</li>
<li>Copy the URL of Web Apps. It's like <code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/###/exec</code>.

<ul>
<li><strong>When you modified the Google Apps Script, please redeploy as new version. By this, the modified script is reflected to Web Apps. Please be careful this.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3>4. Run the function using Web Apps.</h3>

<p>Please access to <code>https://script.google.com/macros/s/###/exec/filename.txt</code> using your browser. By this, a text file is downloaded.</p>

  <li>For users who make apps that connect to the database and need to create or update entities and security roles, you need to assign the System Customizer role in addition to the Environment Maker role.

So, I'll simplify this. The biggest hurdle are the steps to get the refresh token. Once you have that, you can generate countless access tokens that are used to make the actual API calls.</p>

<h1>How To Get Your Refresh Token</h1>

<ol>
<li>Login to your Zoho CRM <em>with an admin-level account</em> and have that open in a tab. Then, in another browser tab, login into the Developer API Console: <a href=""https://api-console.zoho.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://api-console.zoho.com/</a></li>
<li>In the Developer API Console, you need to create a Server-Side Client. The fields should be populated like so: <strong>Client Name</strong> (any logical name you want), <strong>Homepage URL</strong> (the homepage of the domain where you're going to be making the API calls, or just use the same URL for where you're doing the redirects), <strong>Authorized Redirect URIs</strong> (put a web page up on the domain where you're going to make the API call and make it emit nothing more than ""zoho confirmed""). (The ""zoho confirmed"" is not required and not mentioned in the docs, but does help you understand the process better.) Click Create.</li>
<li>Once created, click on it again and there's a tab called Client Secret. Click it and record in a notepad your <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client Secret</strong>.</li>
<li>Take a URL encoder script online (or use PHP or any other tool) and URL encode the following parameters for a new URL you need to compose and load in your browser in the next step:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>scope: ZohoCRM.modules.ALL,ZohoCRM.settings.ALL,ZohoCRM.users.ALL,ZohoCRM.org.ALL,aaaserver.profile.ALL,ZohoCRM.settings.functions.all,ZohoCRM.notifications.all,ZohoCRM.coql.read,ZohoCRM.files.create,ZohoCRM.bulk.all
response_type: code
access_type: offline
client_id: {use the Client ID you recorded in step 3}
redirect_uri: {use the Authorized Redirect URI you generated in step 2}
</code></pre>

<ol start=""5"">
<li>With those URL encoded parameters, pass them to the end of this URL in your browser: <code>https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/auth?</code> Thus, you would have something similar to:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/auth?scope=ZohoCRM.modules.ALL%2CZohoCRM.settings.ALL%2CZohoCRM.users.ALL%2CZohoCRM.org.ALL%2Caaaserver.profile.ALL%2CZohoCRM.settings.functions.all%2CZohoCRM.notifications.all%2CZohoCRM.coql.read%2CZohoCRM.files.create%2CZohoCRM.bulk.all&amp;client_id=1000.TTT0BSTTTC9TTTRILR3MGXBYAC82LH&amp;response_type=code&amp;access_type=offline&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%3Azohoconfirm
</code></pre>

<p><em>Please note that if your redirect URI (like <a href=""https://example.com/zohoconfirm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://example.com/zohoconfirm</a>, above) does another redirection with like a 301 or 302 redirect and doesn't also forward those query parameters, then you'll lose the parameters you need to see when finished.</em></p>

<ol start=""6"">
<li><p>Once you load that in your browser, you will see an Accept button. If you do not, then you may have missed that in step 1 you were supposed to login to the CRM in one tab, and then open a new tab to do other tasks. That makes a session open for you and it knows who you are when doing step 5.</p></li>
<li><p>After you click the Accept button, Zoho's account system will redirect you to your Authorized Redirect URI that you specified. So, if you followed these steps exactly, you should see some output like ""zoho confirmed"". But do not close the tab. Look at the URL of the tab and cut/paste it into your notepad. In there, grab that <strong>code</strong> parameter.</p></li>
<li><p>Now that you have that code parameter, you need to create a special Curl POST request. You can do this either via command line or with your favorite programming language. From command line on Linux, this would look something like the following:</p></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>curl ""https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token"" \
-X POST \
-d ""grant_type=authorization_code&amp;code=1000.aaa1f9aa8582eaaaafeaddfaf0f3b6b.bf7fe646ba899783501c21a9a3240aaa&amp;client_id=1000.AAAA0BSIC7C9AAAARILR3MGXBYAC8AAA&amp;client_secret=aaa9aa9166055932ff8c0279c6253a65cb534daaaa&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fzohoconfirm""
</code></pre>

<p>The URL-encoded parameters you need to fill out are:</p>

<pre><code>grant_type: authorization_code
code: {the code you recorded from step 7}
client_id: {the Client ID you recorded in step 3}
client_secret: {the Client Secret you recorded in step 3}
redirect_uri: {the Authorized Redirect URI you recorded in step 2}
</code></pre>

<ol start=""9"">
<li>Once you run that Curl command, it will return some JSON that looks similar to the following:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>{""access_token"":""1000.aaaa5579abeea73871b096c941ec1df8.7835dbb43bbf5122f2d5810f0b65aaa"",""refresh_token"":""1000.aaaa2683a1723d1aeb7b58899849aaaa.aaaa4c22481da67e85e598f4b988aaa"",""api_domain"":""https://www.zohoapis.com"",""token_type"":""Bearer"",""expires_in"":3600}
</code></pre>

<ol start=""10"">
<li>Now, in the JSON output, you <em>could</em> use that <strong>access_token</strong> to make an API call to generate the lead, but you're better off just taking that <strong>refresh_token</strong> and putting that in a configuration file for later use in your programming. According to their documentation, their refresh_token lasts forever. You should keep this in an extremely secure place.</li>
</ol>

<h1>How To Get Your Access Token</h1>

<ol>
<li>Now that you get your <strong>refresh_token</strong>, you use it to generate a fresh <strong>access_token</strong> each time you need to make an API call. To do that, make another Curl POST with a URL similar to below. In Linux command line with Curl, as an example, here's what it would look like:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>curl ""https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token"" \
-X POST \
-d ""grant_type=refresh_token&amp;refresh_token=1000.aaaa2683a1723d1aeb7b58899849aaaa.aaaa4c22481da67e85e598f4b988aaa&amp;client_id=1000.AAAA0BSIC7C9AAAARILR3MGXBYAC8AAA&amp;client_secret=aaa9aa9166055932ff8c0279c6253a65cb534daaaa""
</code></pre>

<p>Here's an explanation of how to do the URL-encoded parameters:</p>

<pre><code>grant_type: refresh_token
refresh_token: {use the refresh_token (the one I said that would last forever) from your stored config file from step 10 in the previous steps}
client_id: {use your client_id}
client_secret: {use your client_secret} 
</code></pre>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Running the above command should return to you some JSON that looks similar to:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>{""access_token"":""1000.aaa1c95788b34226c2844a841bfd1d5.6aff70f4adbc3fee9e6b57579e481aaa"",""api_domain"":""https://www.zohoapis.com"",""token_type"":""Bearer"",""expires_in"":3600}
</code></pre>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>In your favorite programming language, you'll be storing that <strong>access_token</strong> you received in a temporary variable so that you can make an API call to do something like add a Zoho CRM Lead. That access token will last 3600 seconds (1 hour), but really is of no consequence because you can generate infinite access tokens since you have that refresh_token stored in a configuration file.</li>
</ol>

<h1>How To Create A Zoho CRM Lead</h1>

<ol>
<li>In your favorite programming language, you'll be using that refresh token to create an access token, and then using it for the following header to pass in your API call:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken XXXXXX
</code></pre>

<p>...where XXXXXX is the access_token you received from the previous set of instructions.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Here's a sample in PHP with file_get_contents (although you can do the same with PHP's Curl) to make a request to add a Zoho CRM Lead. You can take the following example and recode it in your favorite programming language. Change the $sAccessToken value to the one you generated. </li>
</ol>

<p>Note, below, we're also writing into a field called ""Lead Source"", and it's API-accessible name is ""Lead_Source"". (If you end up changing the code below to write into Contacts or Accounts, then you'll want to create a custom field, I'm sure, to indicate where the contact or account came from. For instance, if you have a shopping cart, then you could indicate the record came from completing that transaction, rather than a customer calling in.)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

ini_set('display_errors','On');

<p>To understand where to find the API-addressable field names, in your CRM, go to: Setup > Developer Space > APIs > API Names > Leads. Choose ""Fields"" from the ""Filter By"" drop-down.</p>

<p>Note that this API does not look for duplicates. You can adapt the above to do an ""upsert"" instead of an ""insert"": <a href=""https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/upsert-records.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/upsert-records.html</a></p>

<p>If you edit the Contacts and Accounts to have the same custom fields as Leads, then you can change the <code>https://www.zohoapis.com/crm/v2/Leads</code> line to <code>https://www.zohoapis.com/crm/v2/Contacts</code> or <code>https://www.zohoapis.com/crm/v2/Accounts</code> and write entries into those as well.</p>
