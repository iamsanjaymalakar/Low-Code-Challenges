To my understanding query filters are calculated and applied client side although this might be totally and completely incorrect and applying filters may very well change the loading state of a datasource.  I would suggest setting up a simple test which constantly outputs `datasource.loading` while changing query filters on calculated models to make sure.,2018-07-12T14:54:12.550,9962755,CC BY-SA 4.0

When using a date field to present in the client, the default format is in YYYY-MM-DD at least in the US.

It is hard to say in your question how you determine which students need to have an attendance record created.
